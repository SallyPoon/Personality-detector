//_path/untitled13,22,Mark Dorf,https://www.seditionart.com/mark-dorf/_path-untitled13,"An examination of contemporary life in Western culture shows how completely our world has been influenced by digital technology and the World Wide Web. The Internet and digital technology have moved from the periphery to the forefront of human interaction, and continue to become ever more entrenched in our daily lives. Mark Dorf is interested in the ways in which we have become dependent upon this technology; to what extent we rely upon the digital realm to navigate our lives, and how this reliance affects our perception of the world around us socially, emotionally, and physically. It is no longer about logging on or off, but rather living within and in harmony with the realms and constructs of the digital world for our newest generation of inhabitants.For Sedition, Dorf presents two limited editions from his //_PATH series composed of photography and moving images. In //_PATH the artist explores these ideas through digital photography, collage, 3D rendering, and primitive 3D scanning technology. Dorf uses strict geometric and synthetic forms to contrast against the natural landscape against which they are viewed; a comparison of visual language. In Dorf’s view, the natural landscape can be seen as the most ancient of symbolic languages - the original set of symbols that birthed all of modern language; nature is the master text. Using this juxtaposition of landscape and contemporary digital language, Dorf explores the ongoing capture and digitisation of our environment through the use of pure colour and the native tools of contemporary digital imaging that are used to create meaning and manipulation in mass media.","An examination of contemporary life in Western culture shows how completely our world has been influenced by digital technology and the World Wide Web.

"1,000 Pounds",30,Sui Jianguo,https://www.seditionart.com/sui_jianguo/1_000_pounds,"It certainly is not easy for a digital two-dimensional piece of art to transmit three-dimensionality and the material reality of classic sculpture. And yet, Sui Jianguo achieves exactly this with his work 1,000 Pounds: we watch the rapid manipulation of a chunk of clay. But we do not ever see the artist; the fast moving film only shows the changing imprints of his hands into the material: the mutating matter opens and closes, stretches and compresses, it gapes with holes and smoothes over in finger-imprinted ripples.1,000 Pounds reminds aesthetically of Sui Jianguo's early sculptural work of the 1990s, characteristically of a more organic and abstract character and material. 1,000 Pounds also pays homage to the most classic practice of modern sculpture itself: the dedicated modelling and remodelling by the artist's hand. Auguste Rodin made his name when he decided to move away from the Baroque and neo-Baroque smooth surfaces of 19th century sculptural tradition. He opted for textured surfaces and the extreme interplay of light and shadow - made possible by strong modelling techniques that did not obscure the expressive impact of the artist. In its entirety, 1,000 Pounds seems to convey exactly this: the physical impact of the hand onto clay, the concreteness of the flesh, the brutality contained within the act of forcing the bare earth into a shape decided by the artist.Upon completion, 1,000 Pounds was cast by Sui Jianguo into bronze. It exists as a artwork in its own right and physical form.","It certainly is not easy for a digital two-dimensional piece of art to transmit three-dimensionality and the material reality of classic sculpture.

The latter is a so-called collage engine, a programme that uses terrestrial television signals as raw material and transcribes them into visual footage. Reas: “Like early twentieth-century collages built from the media of that time, and (comparable to) mid 20th century video collage, Signal to Noise fractures and distorts contemporary information into new data structure”.For 100% Gray Coverage, Reas developed a newer more evolved collage engine to create imagery: the video is completely abstract and moves at a rapid pace. However, rudiments of what remind the viewer of television images appear occasionally, and the speed with which animation and colour sequences change recalls quick channel-surfing. 100% Gray Coverage visually combines a familiar aesthetic of the modern age - television and the disruption or flicker of distorted signals or channels changed at high speeds - and contemporary computer generated animation.Casey Reas created 100% Gray Coverage in conjunction with Infinite Command Team, both 10 minutes in length and interlinked, utilising the same collage engine.","Casey Reas’ 10 minutes digital video-piece 100% Gray Coverage, exclusively available on Sedition, was derived from Reas’ work Signal to Noise.

In physical terms, a transfiguration is a change in form, a remodeling of appearance. The word derives from the ancient Greek ‘metemorphothe’ or 'metamorphosis,’ suggesting a complete reformation. However, the word takes on its fullest meaning in the spiritual context when it refers to the moment when a person or an object is transformed not by external means but from within. The resulting change is absolute and thorough, affecting the heart and soul of the subject. Although the outward appearance can sometimes be altered in this process as well, it is not necessary. A deeper, more profound, complete transformation occurs inside, out of sight and, for a person it reformulates the very fiber of their being, finally radiating outward to affect everything around it.” Bill Viola.","For over 40 years Bill Viola has created architectural video installations, video films, sound environments, electronic music performances, flat panel video pieces, and works for television broadcast, as well as music concerts, opera and sacred spaces.

In mathematical terms, this number is fairly small considering the endless possibilities between naught and infinity. If visualized in single digits, 124,761,600 is unimaginably large. However a number that needs this many digits to describe it is utterly beyond human comprehension! With A Single Number That Has 124,761,600 Digits, Ryoji Ikeda brings all 124,761,600 digits before our eyes. In doing so he demonstrates a simple mathematical fact: that - due to their computational complexity - it is impossible to verify whether this number of digits are randomly placed, or following a pattern.The whole 124,761,600 digits - in what appears a random blur of static - run in front of our eyes over the screen. The animation is accompanied by a high pitched varying sound that represents the frequency of the actual number the viewer is witnessing. At times, the sequence comes to a halt and pauses - and only then is it possible to recognise the many small digits covering the screen. One may not find any meaning of certain large numbers, which are in fact the majority of numbers.

The work contrasts Chinese ancient traditions through scripture, family names and the medium tofu, set amidst the historically lush and untouched Sichuan countryside, with the smooth, fast and intangible hardness of new infrastructure. The sculpted family names are common throughout China, evoking ordinary Chinese people; a point further stressed by the medium because of its widespread use as basic Chinese ingredient. The road - photographed by Chen without beginning or end in sight, seems to catapult the letters - the common Chinese, towards an undefined and possibly more stringent future.About Chen recalls the original work in situ by focusing on the decomposition of a single tofu letter, filmed in time lapse, and once more poses the question whether contemporary changes within China create a society of opportunity or a society of loss. Chen’s work investigated Chinese traditions and history and its current role and is deeply concerned with China’s rapid and often destructive urbanisation.Chen Qiulin lives and works in Chengdu and Beijing, China.","Chen Qiulin’s work About Chen is an extension of the artist’s iconic performance and installation piece Tofu - 100 Chinese Surnames, 2004.

His designs have been highly regarded, not only for their graphic sophistication and aesthetic, but because of Saville's ability to recontextualize images from one genre into another - epitomizing postmodern practice. After Closer (Digital Edition) references the transition of the band Joy Division to New Order following the suicide of Joy Division's singer and songwriter Ian Curtis. It directly recalls the last album recorded by Joy Division, Closer, and originally was conceived as a limited edition screen print in 2011 for the Postmodernism exhibition held at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. In its digital format, After Closer (Digital Edition) highlights the historical narrative of the work even more: the black square in the centre of the composition represents the original cover-art for the Closer album by Joy Division. It is symbolically deleted and surrounded by two day-glo colour changing technical fields that frame the black centre. The inner field consistently catches up with the outer field's change in colour, and sometimes the two merge: as if New Order were forever more born from Joy Division, albeit eternally separate.","Peter Saville is most famous for his work with Factory Records, the music label that represented iconic bands like Joy Division and New Order.

The poppy itself is probably one of the most important flowers man has a relationship with throughout history; it’s uses include aid to the ritual of worship, a medicinal tool (a cure for many ailments), a poison for assassins, cause for military and trade wars.

The opera The Woman Who Refused To Dance,  is about an unknown woman on the slave boat of Captain Kimber in 1792 who refused to dance and is beaten and hung for arbitration. Although the unknown woman dies, in this new filmed production, All The World Is Now Richer Meets The Woman Who Refused to Dance, her spirit rises and reunites with her ancestors.

It invites viewers to salute the survivors who have contributed to the lives we lead today. Camp’s sculptural works were presented in The House of Commons, and then went on to Bristol Cathedral, Norwich Cathedral and St George’s Hall in Liverpool in 2012.

It invites viewers to salute the survivors who have contributed to the lives we lead today. Camp’s sculptural works were presented in The House of Commons, and then went on to Bristol Cathedral, Norwich Cathedral and St George’s Hall in Liverpool in 2012. They were then exhibited St Paul’s Cathedral London, 2014 and the Doge’s Prigioni Venice, 2016.",Introverted,Intuitive,Feeling,Perceiving

ALMOST HOME,24,Alex McLeod,https://www.seditionart.com/alex-mcleod/almost-home,"In Alex McLeod’s ALMOST HOME a metallic geometric form travels through a grassy landscape created as a 3D animated environment accompanied by a bucolic soundscape. The movements of the figure are simultaneously creature-like and machine-like. Through its composition, the relationship between the pursuing camera and the roaming figure, and the irregularity of its camera movements, the work references Open World or Free Roam, a style of video gaming whose central character moves through their virtual world with a high degree of freedom in contrast to more linear styles of play. The freedom of the player in Open World gaming makes any restrictions put in place - whether necessitated by the limitations of game design or put in place by the game designer - more obvious. The central figure in ALMOST HOME moves through its world following an irregular route which suggests freedom - but the suggestion of a controlling presence behind the camera and the ambiguous production methods call this freedom into question. The form navigates itself through the landscape of grass and trees, followed closely by the camera. Birds sing in the background along with sounds of wind and the peaceful rustling of leaves. The wind stops as the form hovers in the air; a black hole appears, into which the form vanishes.","In Alex McLeod’s ALMOST HOME a metallic geometric form travels through a grassy landscape created as a 3D animated environment accompanied by a bucolic soundscape.

And It Was Done,22,Carla Gannis,https://www.seditionart.com/carla-gannis/and-it-was-done,"Still Image, 4096 x 2160 pixels, 2016About the work: In the fall of 2013 I began work on the project ""The Garden of Emoji Delights,"" an “emoji transcription"" of Hieronymus Bosch’s enduring triptych ""The Garden of Earthly Delights."" I have produced 2D and 3D prints and numerous moving image works inspired by the 3 inner panels. However this new work “And It Was Done” is a translation of the triptych in its closed position, a nod to 2016 being the 500 year anniversary of Bosch’s death.Bosch painted the outer panels in grisaille, a technique of painting in shades of neutral grayish colors. When the panels are closed, a transparent planet-like sphere is revealed with God hovering above in the left corner of the composition. This work has been interpreted as either a depiction of the Flood, or the third day in the creation of the world. There is an inscription along the top that can be translated: “For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”  In my version, I have extended the scene into a panoramic 4K aspect ratio that allows for the inclusion of other celestial and machine bodies. Hybrid organisms, for example a “bunny cam” and an “octoplasma screen” inhabit the anthropomorphized central planet, along with various forms of vegetation and a scattering of human artifacts.  I’ve chosen a Walter Benjamin quote as my re-inscription.

As the songbirds appear, they begin to morph into individual letters that transform the electrical cables into a lyrical statement. The work’s beauty resides in its evocative sounds and spirit that recreate a jarring cityscape, as nature poetically intervenes upon the industrial facade.

Artificial Botany DLXXVI,50,fuse*,https://www.seditionart.com/fuse/artificial-botany-dlxxvi,"Artificial Botany is an ongoing project which explores the latent expressive capacity of botanical illustrations through the use of machine learning algorithms. Before the invention of photography, botanical illustration was the only way to visually record the many species of plants. These images were used by physicists, pharmacists, and botanical scientists for identification, analysis, and classification.While these works are no longer scientifically relevant today, they have become an inspiration for artists who pay homage to life and nature using contemporary tools and methodologies. Artificial Botany draws from public domain archive images of illustrations by the greatest artists of the genre, including Maria Sibylla Merian, Pierre-Joseph Redouté, Anne Pratt, Mariann North, and Ernst Haeckel.Developing as an organism in an interweaving of forms that are transmitted and flow into each other, the plant is the symbol of nature’s creative power. In this continuous activity of organizing and shaping forms two opposing forces in tension are confronted: on one hand, the tendency to the shapeless, the fluidity of passing and changing; on the other, the tenacious power to persist, the principle of crystallization of the flow, without which it would be lost indefinitely. In the dynamic of expunction and contraction that marks the development of the plant, beauty manifests itself in that moment of balance which is impossible to fix, caught in its formation and already in the point of fading into the next one.This version of the work is characterized by a grid inside which different modules are gradually revealed. This narration offers an unusual perspective on the generative process allowing the viewer to appreciate the overall dynamics and, at the same time, the detail of the individual flowers.","Artificial Botany is an ongoing project which explores the latent expressive capacity of botanical illustrations through the use of machine learning algorithms.

In this continuous activity of organizing and shaping forms two opposing forces in tension are confronted: on one hand, the tendency to the shapeless, the fluidity of passing and changing; on the other, the tenacious power to persist, the principle of crystallization of the flow, without which it would be lost indefinitely. In the dynamic of expunction and contraction that marks the development of the plant, beauty manifests itself in that moment of balance which is impossible to fix, caught in its formation and already in the point of fading into the next one.This version of the work is characterized by a grid inside which different modules are gradually revealed. This narration offers an unusual perspective on the generative process allowing the viewer to appreciate the overall dynamics and, at the same time, the detail of the individual flowers.",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Perceiving

Ashes,26,NONOTAK,https://www.seditionart.com/nonotak/ashes,"Ashes is an audiovisual piece that explores the mechanised experience of NONOTAK’s piece Masks. The visual is as abstract as the ambient soundtrack is technologically. Clinically choreographed, every sound grasping jerk, and corresponding twist is spliced into an audio-tractive rhythm. The music serves as a precursor for a maturing new visual. The work explores the optical illusion created by peering through pixelated glass at different angles. The work resembles nothing more than televised interference stripes, appearing to evolve and dissolve into the architectonic atmosphere.The simplicity of the work proves almost hypnotic, as the work calls for a new virtual experience, or otherwise appearing as an innovative music video. The all-embracing sensation of sound and technology are the measure of the works modernity.

How have media technologies changed our conceptualizations of space, and how has architecture embraced these shifting conceptualizations?

The baroque work, originally created as a relief sculpture, reflects upon the individual’s state of mind, in a society the artist sees as burdened by social stresses and strains. The piece was created partly in response to the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, on the day immediately after London had won its bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games. The successful bid highlighted the city's multicultural reputation, but this was contradicted in a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks that took place across London’s public transport, resulting in 52 deaths and over 700 injuries. The work embodies the anxiety and chaos of a state attempting to celebrate its global influence even as events subverted the moment. Black Queen, as a sculptural work, was made in the aftermath of the Iraq War, and is built up on a base of black plastic M-16 machine guns.

It is at the cusp of such anatomical changes that Novak turns his attention to the variables of sound, in order to create an impressive audio induced narrative that carries the work into its limitless afterlife. As the image deviates little, so the audio rises like a spacecraft intent on breaking free of the earth.Blue Hour is an abridged version of a large multichannel audio-visual installation, and is based on photographs and sound recordings collected at Joshua Tree National Park in June 2010.",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Perceiving
BOOK - Landscape,46,Lee Lee Nam,https://www.seditionart.com/lee_lee_nam/book-landscape,"Lee Lee Nam is famous for breathing life and animation into traditional art in a way that reinvents the imagery through the lens and preoccupations of the contemporary world. With the help of digital tools, the artist plays with the limits of time and space imposed on two dimensional representation.In BOOK - Landscape, Lee Lee Nam borrows two traditional works by different artists, from different regions and periods - and combines the two: Visiting a Friend in the Moonlit, by Dai Jin (right hand side illustration), and A Landscape by Xie Shichen (left hand side). The images depict everyday life in rural China and come alive, evolving through the seasons and drawing the viewer into the narrative . Flora and fauna change through spring and summer, until the landscapes are drowned by snowfall and night; figures are animated; a punter moves his boat; tradesmen travel with their animals and goods across the screen. The two images are graphically framed as a lot in an auction catalogue and illustrated with titles, date and signature stamp. However, the soundtrack and hybrid animation that moves between frames (the frame of the book and the frame of the screen) expand and confuse any time-space narrative: what is inside and what is outside, what is real and what is fiction, becomes blurred.Lee Lee Nam’s BOOK - Landscape allows two unrelated works to generate a visual dialogue and transcend the barriers between past and present. In presenting - as parts of a whole - two distinct and separate works, BOOK - Landscape calls into question our understanding of temporal boundaries, and offers a new perspective of time, space, history and art - it is a beautiful example of Lee Lee Nam’s oeuvre, and a powerful dialogue between old and new.","Lee Lee Nam is famous for breathing life and animation into traditional art in a way that reinvents the imagery through the lens and preoccupations of the contemporary world.

It is as though any trace of tissue or consistency of muscle has been replaced by a computer construct that holds this isolated organ ransom to the whims of an alien authority. Microscopic in detail, the artist threads an impressive elastic frame, made up of a vast network of razor sharp strokes,  entirely over and around the brain.  This imposing structure both emphasises and stifles the organ as it subtly turns on its axis. A whole matrix of protruding coloured threads tighten and become tensile around Haudressy’s reconstructed entity as this impressively rendered body part rotates very slightly while the obtruding mesh frame surrounding it causes alterations like a parasite attached to a host.","Rendered entirely in the colour blue, Brain (White Version) (2015) is a work that begins with what initially appears to be a scribble scratched onto a white void.

For the exhibition, Collishaw restages the world’s first exhibition of photography, which was presented in 1839 by British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot at King Edward’s School in Birmingham. The immersive VR experience transports viewers into the past where visitors can touch vitrines and fixtures which have been re-created in a life-size room. Breaking Faith is launched in support of Collishaw’s Kickstarter campaign for the exhibition where it is given as a reward to backers of the project.The digital edition for Sedition features photographs by Talbot that digitally degrade and glitch. Printed photographs degrade with time, as Talbot’s photographic prints from the original exhibition have done. In the process they become lost relics of the past that cannot be recuperated. Similarly, the digital image can degrade, presenting a haunting image of the past as it fades with digital corruption. Breaking Faith replicated this degradation through its imagery as well as through its sound. The soundtrack is noisy and fuzzy with distortion and is overlaid by sounds of heavy rain, creating a dark and ominous atmosphere, which express the fragility of the digital image and the threat of data loss and file corruption in the digital age.","Mat Collishaw’s Breaking Faith is a video artwork that reflects on the changing nature of image-based technologies from the birth of photography to the digital image, the internet and now VR technologies.The work is presented alongside Collishaw’s first VR exhibition and installation Thresholds which launches at Somerset House in London in May 2017 before touring across the UK.

The image becomes a glimpse into the fourth dimension; time collapses on itself and is inseparable from the space around it.Here the figures and bodies are pushed towards abstraction, giving them a painterly quality. Creating her own photographic paper, she applies the emulsion roughly so that the brushstrokes are visible and integrated to the print, each of which is unique as a result. Colbert further emphasises the materiality of image-making in her development process.

Congregation,25,Andrew Thomas Huang,https://www.seditionart.com/andrew-thomas-huang/congregation,"In his video work Congregation, Andrew Thomas Huang examines the construction of ritual as performance. The work derives from Interstice, a choreographed performance which pulls apart the characteristics of ritual and frames them as repeated metronomic intervals. The work deconstructs public performance in order to examine a formula for ritual; it turns theatrics simultaneously into spectacle, language and shared sensory experience. Accompanied by a rousing soundtrack, the artist fixes the viewer’s gaze on what appears to be a gathering of semi-clothed men on all fours in dark masks; on closer inspection the bodies are revealed to be the same figure duplicated and doctored so that each ‘unit’ moves in sequence with its replicated other. The figure is portrayed by the ballet-trained Flex dancer Brixx, who twists and turns against a ruby coloured canvas, whilst appearing transfixed by the centrally staged lantern. The lantern’s movement resembles a gilded object reminiscent of an orthodox thuribles; simultaneously it keeps time as precisely as a metronome; the collected bodies become contorted by their devotion to the source of light as emblematic of something other.","In his video work Congregation, Andrew Thomas Huang examines the construction of ritual as performance.

The lantern’s movement resembles a gilded object reminiscent of an orthodox thuribles; simultaneously it keeps time as precisely as a metronome; the collected bodies become contorted by their devotion to the source of light as emblematic of something other.",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Judging
Conjugal Visits,75,David Choe,https://www.seditionart.com/david-choe/conjugal-visits,"David Choe’s 2.15 minute video Conjugal Visits is a hybrid mix of the grotesque, the perverse and the symbolic. The film is a self-portrait that shows the artist lying on his back ingesting and then releasing several butterflies, all the while fixating the camera with his stare. The scene is shot in slow motion and triggers fascination and repulsion simultaneously due to the juxtaposition of the naked human body with the insect. Most prominently, however, the content of the film is contrasted by the title Conjugal Visits. If taken literally, the question arises who is prisoner and who is visitor: Choe or the butterfly? Butterflies have long been symbols for the human soul: the ancient Greek word for ‘butterfly’ is ψυχή (psȳchē), meaning ‘soul’ or ‘mind’; whereas in Japanese culture, a butterfly entering a house is considered a deceased loved one visiting. Conjugal Visits takes on the form of a highly reflexive self-portrait if one contextualises the title with traditional symbolism.David Choe lives and works in Los Angeles, California.","David Choe’s 2.15 minute video Conjugal Visits is a hybrid mix of the grotesque, the perverse and the symbolic.

The works express self as both a fragile construct requiring constant work and a powerful structure through which to navigate and process the world.""What we are what we are not. Our will eradicates doubt as we struggle with faith. All that I will never be- define who I am. I strive to complete the picture, knowing full well that I will run out of time.After you have put off facing the truth for as long as possible, and you have lied and cheated in order not to cry – there remains the euphoria of release. Redemption lies in the confession of our sins. We fear our failures because we’ve been schooled to “win”. It’s prohibited to embrace collapse – it’s a sign of weakness and ruin. Anything out of the norm is not to be spoken of in public – and in fact if you can ignore it completely – do it.We are shamed by our own morality.There is no disgrace to failure; it’s a fact of life. Catastrophe fuels evolution and disappointments release catharsis.

These natural geometries and forms are re-constructed and re-presented as fragments of a virtual ecosystem that could be extracted from the world of dreams and imagination.

The forms differ in scale, surface texture, colour and semiotic connections; the result is a field of interactions which suggests the possibility of hybrid forms emerging from a particular calibration of order and chaos. The intangible materiality of the rendered objects and textures that make up the Prosomiosis project builds an abstract syntax of organic digital elements that could exist on the threshold of actuality and fiction and provoke thoughts on the constantly changing synthesis of fiction and material reality.","Prosomiosis is the Greek word for simulation; the term refers to the simulation of reality and its phenomena.

Unlike the conventional binary on-off configuration used in computing, neurons are capable of switching between thousands of states, meaning wetware computers have the potential to be far more dynamic and self-organising than conventional computers. Sodeoka’s fascination with the self-organising computer led him to experiment with audiovisual feedback loops. The videos in the Wetware collection grew from a few seeds of graphic and audio information which was animated, then mutated by automatic video feedback. The resulting visuals are generated by this feedback. This feedback continues to generate forever unless instructed to stop. Like evolutionary processes in nature, the result is often unpredictable and hard to control. “It almost seems like the video feedback has an artificial organic brain. I expect it to do one specific thing and it won't usually occur. It requires endless amount of experimentation to get the result I want. It's almost like training a cat!

Coordinated Movement,24,Mike Pelletier,https://www.seditionart.com/mike-pelletier/coordinated-movement,"Coordinated Movement is an experimental animation by Canadian artist Mike Pelletier. The work’s starting point was derived from open source motion capture data released by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, where the artist observed the awkward process of capturing the behaviour of the body when producing motion capture animations of swimming people. The process involves people simulating swimming movements on raised benches with sensors on specific joints; the movements of these sensors are mapped to produce an animated body which appears both human and alien. In Coordinated Movement, bodies swim through a void, their algorithmically rendered outlines and movements rippling and glitching as though distorted by water. At times, the figures glitch, distorting in unexpected ways or disintegrate into triangle mesh frameworks at their edges.The work is produced using open source motion capture software. The artist experiments with the capabilities of the algorithms used to render the images of the swimming bodies, incorporating glitches alongside intended outcomes. Coordinated Movement explores the way in which bodies are captured and rendered as data, both in terms of the traces of humanity which are lost and the traces that remain. The work received an honorary mention in Computer Animation at the 2016 Prix Ars Electronica. ","Coordinated Movement is an experimental animation by Canadian artist Mike Pelletier.

Similarly to the islanders with their poor toolkit and primitive techniques, the contemporary artist has a rather narrow and very specific set of tools and techniques at his disposal.

For preliminary works one uses such hardware tools as photo and video cams, microphones, 3D scanners, computers. Besides the data obtained by means of hardware tools one often uses digital data available on various Internet resources and services. At the materialization stage one uses contemporary printers, plotters, milling machines, 3D printers and only very rarely traditional techniques such as moulding or painting.

Dispossession,20,Heidi Locher,https://www.seditionart.com/heidi-locher/dispossession,"Dispossession is a video artwork composed of 65 still images taken by the artist in a location in Southern Italy. Through this photo-roman, Heidi Locher presents a full investigation of a temporary structure: a hut and its surroundings. The piece forms part of an installation of the same name which is presented in an exhibition at TRACE Projects Berlin in April 2018. The exhibition curated by Brunno Silva combines photography, sculpture, projection and other formats inspired by the artist’s personal observations of the space. Working across architectural forms and visual art, Heidi Locher’s work is a celebration and examination of the idiosyncrasies and inventiveness that arise when a building is made away from the influences of architecture. The building being recreated has already been reconfigured by nature, human hands, and tools. Where in blueprints there is no room for improvisation, it is still possible to discover sites where untrained builders engineer spaces for living, working and resting. Regardless of the lack of formal architectural education, these improvised structures utilise core elements of architecture in inventive ways.As well as exploring the facets and textures of the structure, Dispossession also looks at the relation between architecture and art as an ongoing dialogue in stretching concepts and materials. By isolating and enhancing details Locher illustrates the tense architectonic boundary where the hut exists, in a new sort of harmony. Dispossession, illuminates the intriguing forms of the building while emphasising in the fluidity of the fabrics attached to the hut, that serve simultaneously as a wall, window and door.","Dispossession is a video artwork composed of 65 still images taken by the artist in a location in Southern Italy.

Dust Restriction is derived from a larger body of work titled Dust which includes performances and installations featuring dust accumulations - allowing the viewer to perceive and hear dust on immense scale.Dust is inspired by Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray’s collaboration Elevage de Poussiere (Dust Breeding, 1920), where Man Ray photographed Duchamp’s iconic work The Large Glass (1915-1923) after it had collected one year’s worth of dust while Duchamp was in New York. In Dust, Kolgen references both aesthetic and process underlying Duchamp’s - and by extension Man Ray’s - work.At the edge of the imperceptible, pigments are suspended around a magnetic field. Random fibrous networks take shape and then form composite objects, hypnotic in their complexity.

The aesthetics of garbage piles and perpetual city repairs permeate our lives and become part of everyday reality. This breeds a sensation of “perpetual temporariness”—as if this all is just about to end and you will be able to simply enjoy the flow of life. Yet, this temporariness has firmly rooted itself in our lives. We now need to learn to live with it or try and drastically change something, falling into the pit of temporariness again.Accumulating possessions grow too costly to store and ultimately turn into a briefcase without a handle, or what is called a “toxic asset.” According to post-consumerism, the escape from this situation is in consumption relieved of a material good and, again, the options abound: rentals, subscriptions, networks for shared use of things or housing without transfer of property titles.Post-consumerism is a new, “green” consumerism; it is an old, stale product in a new shiny package.","Dystopia is a video work derived from Aristarkh Chernyshev's 2018 project Toxic assets.The new “residential” housing shown in the work is basically overnight storage for consumer bodies that go to work every morning in order to expand their consumer options, which await them in the nearest temple of Consumption in the evening or on weekends.The lifespans of consumer goods are rapidly shrinking; sometimes purchases are even binned in their intact original packaging.

In this work, Gannis extracted characters from the original Bosch painting and isolated them on pieces of ""virtual paper"" which she then animated over with ""emojified versions.”In her work, Gannis often combines art historical reference with smartphone culture, layering and splicing works from the “Canon” with contemporary imagery. This process of remixing is alternately reflective, parodic, humorous and critical, and allows imagery - and the social constructions behind that imagery - from different places and times to be compared and contrasted. Human tendencies, ideologies, or societal constructions that have ultimately not changed for centuries are at times made visible in the new and little explored language of emoji, while at other times Gannis’s mashups speak to what has changed culturally as a result of paradigm shifts, technology and cultural revolutions.

Though the original painting, from which it is inspired, the work is laid out as a triptych to be read left to right. In Gannis’s version, there is so much imagery in each panel that the viewer’s gaze scrolls down the painting, top to bottom and back. The work is “hyper mediated,” saturated with content and imagery. It transcribes historic figures, elements and narratives - and the histories and societies to which they allude - into a contemporary visual sign system, laying out the connections and differences between the two.A recurring theme in Gannis’s work is digital semiotics and modes of virtual communication. Eden Scroll explores the ways in which these new modes of communication collide with more historical forms of expression, revealing both constancy and change in human nature.","Eden Scroll is one of a series of works in Carla Gannis’s La Emoji Lujuria Collection.

El Dorado,12,Hew Locke,https://www.seditionart.com/hew-locke/el-dorado,"Hew Locke was raised in Guyana, a former British colony and the only English speaking country on the South American mainland. As a child he would fantasise about discovering the golden city of El Dorado that was associated for centuries with an abundance of gold and precious stones. The city was believed by Europeans to exist in the jungles of South America; as a consequence many searched for the treasures of the ‘city of gold’, in quests that ended in the loss of countless lives during the on-going grab for land and wealth in the New World. Locke’s image of our serving monarch, El Dorado, is a sculpture peppered with protruding plastic swords and draped with jewels that conceal the face like a creature colonising a nest. For the artist, the work is partly inspired by the venerated Catholic Spanish statues of the Virgin Mary, including La Macarena of Seville. He explains “I am attracted to this plastic stuff, which is after all designed to be attractive. I like how it looks. It is aspirational. I have tried to take the cheapest thing I can find and work it to make it look precious. The irony here is that the material I am using – such as the golden plastic toy weapons and jewellery – are trying to look expensive.” He adds: “I am not making a critique of mass consumerism – I am just acknowledging it as a reality of our life today. I am very conscious of the fact that this work could not have existed 20 years ago, as these huge amounts of plastic foreign imports were not available in such profusion.”","Hew Locke was raised in Guyana, a former British colony and the only English speaking country on the South American mainland.

Eve, Lilith and Salome - who through their supposedly unnatural acts of defiance, aggression, or desire for autonomy - have been demonised throughout history to serve as a warning as to how disruptive and destructive female sexuality can be if left unchecked.

Feeling Relieved,60,He Yunchang,https://www.seditionart.com/he_yunchang/feeling-relieved,"Chinese artist He Yunchang’s work Feeling Relieved, exclusive to Sedition, is an animated digital portrait of an actual performance work staged by the artist October 3rd, 1999. The work was presented as part of the 2013 Venice Biennale China Pavilion. He Yunchang painted his body yellow, suspended himself in the air for 127 minutes, and held a mirror that reflected the light of the moving sun onto China’s An’ning Prison walls, Yunnan. The 1999 performance was titled Golden Sunshine and is considered iconic, and it is also sometimes linked to another performance work of the same year, Dialogue with Water. In the latter, the artist suspends himself over a river and cuts into the water with a knife while his own blood (from cuts inflicted to his arms) “carves” the water beneath him, for a total of 90 minutes. Dialogue with Water is referenced in Sedition’s Feeling Relieved: the mirror held by the artist in the self portrait shows an image of himself suspended upside down over the river, “cutting it into half”.He Yunchang’s works are highly symbolic and referential and combine existentialism in contemporary China with traditional mythology and ancient philosophy - but the artist most often gets questioned about his continuing willingness to expend his body for the sake of his performances. He Yunchang: “As a human being I feel one should have a lot of pride, like a tree in the primitive forest. He should be able to grow freely. Maybe the wind will take away some branches and leaves, (but) it is normal. I can not take too many restrictions. In doing performance art (like cutting the river with a knife and casting myself in cement) I wanted to overcome many things in the secular world and break its restrictions. (...) And I feel in such attempts you can bring into play the fundamental and inherent attributes of life; namely what you can do an earth as a human being, and to what extent.”He Yunchang lives and works in Beijing.","Chinese artist He Yunchang’s work Feeling Relieved, exclusive to Sedition, is an animated digital portrait of an actual performance work staged by the artist October 3rd, 1999.

Kahn used a 3D scan of her body and applied programming code to the data so as to make it simulate a printed floating piece of fabric with her image on it. The 3D animation is typical of Kahn’s practice, who addresses the resonance of death in the still image and the collisions of perceptions that arise when combining images of the human body with high tech imaging technology. With Fluid Body, the artist directly visualises the theme of death: the skeleton-like rendering of her own body in combination with the fragility of the simulated pulled and pushed cloth submerged in water reference mortality and the fleetingness of life directly.Sophie Kahn lives and works in New York City.","British-Australian artist Sophie Kahn’s work Fluid Body (2014), is a computer simulation of the interaction between materials and elements - namely cloth swimming in water - in conjunction with a self portrait.

These natural geometries and forms are re-constructed and re-presented as fragments of a virtual ecosystem that could be extracted from the world of dreams and imagination. Paradox runs through the work; it can be found in the digital representation of nature, and in the tension between the wildly unfurling forms and the decisions made to arrange, order and shape them.In Fluid Gravitation there is a tension between movement and stillness; digitally rendered fluid forms are frozen in a still image, on the brink of spilling and splashing. Forms which evoke liquid sit alongside forms which are recognisably solid and forms whose composition is ambiguous. The intangible materiality of the rendered objects and textures that make up the Prosomiosis project build an abstract syntax of organic digital elements that could exist on the threshold of actuality and fiction and provoke thoughts on the constantly changing synthesis of fiction and material reality.","Prosomiosis is the Greek word for simulation; the term refers to the simulation of reality and its phenomena.

Kay,https://www.seditionart.com/markos-r-kay/fly-vs-viruses-3,"Fly vs. Viruses is a video work that is part of the Insect Traps series which explores the digital intersections of organic molecules and biological organisms. In the series, virtual insects are injected in closed simulated environments where they fight for their lives against larger than life biomolecular structures. Canted angles and aggressive, conflicting subjects reveal a fundamental tension that is essential to the ecology of these closed environments; such environments are also a key component in incubating and accelerating tension. The binding processes of proteins, the process of viral infection and an insect's ability to scavenge and recycle biological materials all unfold within the confined space, illustrating both the individual creature’s fight to survive and the necessity of a mutualistic relationship with other organisms as part of that survival.Print iterations of Fly vs. Viruses were exhibited at Wallace Space gallery in London 2010. The video was presented inside a mirror box as part of an installation at the Refraction exhibition at the Kopparberg Unestablishment London in 2012.

Wang set up a four metre wide and eight metre long blackboard in Beijing’s Film Studios and covered it in Chinese and English slogans and terminology mirroring the changes in Chinese history, culture and society brought about by recent decades’ economic growth. Texts were mainly taken from Chinese English language textbooks and manuals, in particular the most popular English language-teaching series on China State Television called “Follow Me”, first introduced in 1982.“Follow Me” had sixty programmes that were aired for 12 years, recorded 10 million viewers, sold over 30 million textbooks, and set the Guinness record for people learning English as a foreign language. However, it was more than a language programme: it was a first glimpse of the West. Wang: “Farmers, workers, soldiers and students, even monks at the Lama Temple enjoyed watching the program which provided a window (into the world how) foreigners (...) live.” Twenty years later - after China’s rapid economic reforms and development accompanied by dramatic socio-cultural change - the country is modernising, growing, opening; on the back of a generation of millions of Chinese who first learned about the West through “Follow Me”. Wang himself enjoyed watching the programme while studying at high school. However, according to the artist, he never fully managed to keep up with lessons: “At least on the surface, China is communicating well with the rest of the world.

The result is an abstract space in which to think about freedom and restriction, ideological and computational aggregation.The piece from which the digital edition of Freedom: Red, White and Blue (Quantified and Aggregated) derived from was commissioned in 2011 as part of Artissima’s Mr Freedom Summit, a Bétonsalon project curated by Anna Colin. The artist has chosen to re-release the work and donate its proceeds in order to make the themes of freedom and net neutrality resonate within the context of 2017’s political developments.",Introverted,Intuitive,Feeling,Perceiving
From Third Beach 1,28,Mark Lewis,https://www.seditionart.com/mark-lewis/from-third-beach-1,"Mark Lewis’ short film From Third Beach 1 (2010) quotes the classic cinematic technique of “day for night”: the light of the sun is manipulated to stand in for the luminescence of the moon. Until the 1960’s and the advent of higher speed film, the “day for night” technique was the predominant method of creating a night-time effect in cinema and produced a highly stylised and formal image that bore little resemblance to the actual appearance of night, even during a full moon.Lewis shot From Third Beach 1 in the middle of the day on Vancouver’s Third Beach. The artist was interested to reveal and foreground the kind of moving image usually seen only briefly, often as backdrop projection. The brevity of its appearance in a film and the narrative drama that is often taking place in front of it conspire to hide the sheer beauty of a “day for night film”, its sheer inventiveness as a cinematic form of depiction. In French cinematography in particular, the “day for night” effect became known as la nuit Americaine, directly referencing its Hollywood origin. In From Third Beach 1, Lewis makes it the protagonist itself.Mark Lewis lives and works in London, UK.","Mark Lewis’ short film From Third Beach 1 (2010) quotes the classic cinematic technique of “day for night”: the light of the sun is manipulated to stand in for the luminescence of the moon.

In slow motion the smiling heart jumps back and forth avoiding the onslaught of miscellaneous objects including balls, toys, firecrackers, and coloured liquids. Backed against the wall the heart is literally under attack with nowhere to escape. The heart taunts his assailant as he dances unscathed through the attack and delights in victory over the anonymous perpetrator.Heart Attack is a play on words and a comedic interpretation of the heart that defeats a violent attack from an unknown source.

Hierarchy of Concealment,60,Georg Jagunov,https://www.seditionart.com/georg-jagunov/hierarchy-of-concealment,"The digital landscape in Georg Jagunov’s Hierarchy of Concealment emerges from the darkness like a colossal creature slowly making itself seen. The work’s title refers to Arata Isozaki’s book Japan-ness In Architecture in which a holy Shinto shrine is repeatedly rebuilt through a secretive ritual process. It is inspired by two experiences in the artist’s life, in which he came into contact with resonant textures of darkness and light. He explains, “During my studies in Italy, I visited a cave in the Dolomites. After crawling through a narrow passage a group of students entered a cave. They explored it with flashlights casting chaotic rays of light on the body of the cave. Several minutes later the professor asked the students to sit down and turn off the flashlights. In the darkness and silence I could sense the time go differently. These few minutes came as a revelation to me. I could sense something ancient was moving. It was very slow and extremely powerful. Comparing to the cave we humans were just insects or a short flash of light. One day we are there, next day we are gone. It also made me think of Plato’s cave. I retained the memory of that huge womb-like structure.” Subsequently, “One evening, while standing on the rooftop helicopter pad above Mori Art museum in Tokyo I again had similar experience. I was overwhelmed by the endless ocean of light, but just as much by the darkness surrounding the points of light. This two experiences laid the base for this animation..” The artist describes the work as “a light formation against pitch black background forms an island. It evolves, extinguishes and regenerates. Morphing and mimicking the elements of military, industrial, residential and religious sites. The city growing like mycelium.” The animation was constructed from hundreds of photographic and video fragments recorded by Jagunov in Tokyo.","The digital landscape in Georg Jagunov’s Hierarchy of Concealment emerges from the darkness like a colossal creature slowly making itself seen.

The latter was a colleague of Amerika’s at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Amerika's stylized use of experimental hand-held camera techniques bring to mind some of Brakhage’s films, like Mothlight (1963) or Stellar (1993).The work’s title, Honolulu Hermes, references the Olympian god Hermes in ancient Greek mythology and casts Amerika in the light of a trickster, a messenger, a poet and athlete whose manipulated film of himself walking on the beach seems to endow the artist with wings on his feet that allow him to float, to fly - even to walk on water.

Hunters After Jacob Esselens,48,Gordon Cheung,https://www.seditionart.com/gordon-cheung/hunters-after-jacob-esselens,"Hunters After Jacob Esselens is a digital edition by Gordon Cheung based on the oil painting Landscapes with Hunters by Jacob Esselens, dated around 1660-1687 from the Rijksmuseum collection in Amsterdam. Cheung has created an exclusive video artwork for Sedition using glitch techniques where he applies a pixel sorting algorithm developed by Kim Asendorf, used to re-organise the pixels of a high-resolution image of the painting. At first imperceptible, the work gradually renders the painting into digital abstraction, what the artist thinks of as “digital sands of time” – metaphorically suggesting a cycle of history. For Cheung, the relationship between hunter and landscape is a recurring theme throughout history since cave paintings. These scenes are “often romanticised as the dominant species within a majestic landscape, sometimes it is portrayed as a type of nostalgic form of escapism from the political climate of the era or perhaps even in the service of an ideology of conquest in the sense that the land is given by God therefore can be taken from those who do not worship a ’true’ God.”In Hunters After Jacob Esselens, the image is rendered into a time-lapse animation that dissolves into abstraction after the pixels are re-ordered from light to dark. The figures fade in and out as the image of a classical landscape painting blurs and glitches reflecting a contemporary digital aesthetic. Cheung reflects on the present moment through his work: “As we step further into the new millennium our existential questions about the relationship between civilisation and nature become increasingly urgent.”","Hunters After Jacob Esselens is a digital edition by Gordon Cheung based on the oil painting Landscapes with Hunters by Jacob Esselens, dated around 1660-1687 from the Rijksmuseum collection in Amsterdam.

It marks a departure from Hirakawa’s previous films because the artist followed an entirely different method when making I Do Not Dance Tango Anymore: he discarded both storyboard and a script and shot the work without prior concept. Instead, Hirakawa let two dancers, Lexi Andrea and Wei Yao, guide and inspire him.

Carefully constructed mythical crescendos, slow motion deliriums, hyper-beauty, elegance and tenderness come together in an immersive and resonant cinematic work. At the core of this generative project, built around a geometrical layering of sounds and panoramas, is the subtle manipulation of optical nuances and the sequential exploration of such terms as “collapse-rebuild-isolate-take off…”.The piece unfolds in two parts: the first part is exclusively based on a wide range of sonic phenomena where its capture is a direct response to the hostile Icelandic landscape; the second part is based on vibration recordings from Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges in New York and incorporates the voice of a woman mourning her children, who were murdered in the Bosnian civil war. A five-minute excerpt from the second part entitled Riotous Viscera was selected and featured in Lars von Trier’s Gesamt project.","IIC (International Internal Catastrophes) is an audiovisual project by Novi_sad and Isaac Niemand.

The piece is a re-constitution of Ansel Adams’ famous photograph of Yosemite, using digital means and for the digital age.Making the work was a process of interplay between old and new ways of experiencing landscape.

In The Wind,8,Donata Wenders,https://www.seditionart.com/donata-wenders/in-the-wind,"On the beach in southern France with photographer Peter Lindbergh, Donata Wenders records a scene of models embroiled in the gentle commotion that is a temporary plein air photo shoot. Slightly apart from the scene, the photographer captures a heady mix “of the fragrance of the sea, the sand, the salt, the sweat and some perfume.” Wenders’ image, In The Wind (2009), is unconventional for its split narrative. The sand and seascape are pierced by two minute figures in the background, who through their distance are entirely divorced from Lindbergh’s lens; in the foreground, Wenders’ female figure appears entirely unaware of the artist’s presence as the latter stands at the shoulder of her lead character as she moves in and out of shot. In the act of capturing the scene, the blackened costume of the retreating figure becomes the defining detail in the visual interplay the landscape and the unravelling fabric covering her body and upturned hair.

The works explore the formation of self - the concepts that tie us to an idea of self and the everyday challenges we must face to maintain a sense of self. The works express self as both a fragile construct requiring constant work and a powerful structure through which to navigate and process the world.We are powerless to see the whole picture. In a world post-truth where facts are a matter of opinion, this both repels and fascinates us. What’s hidden and what is revealed are our contemporaneous obsessions. So we live double lives, embracing the rich conflicted-ness of things, searching for meaning in those everyday effects – while collecting information by which we imagine we can fashion an equation for closure.Secrets are the teasing wonder of the veiled soul. Not every secret is meant to remain concealed, but holding on to part of the story is essential to sanity. It turns out that what we imagine is often more powerful than what we know, as we let the conscious mind throw away ideas before they have evolved into something more powerful.Art is about trying to subsume thought and calculation into the interior of, say, a love story or a tale of triumph and failure. Existence is an artfully chaotic assemblage of rampant speculation, distorted texts, parodies, sly poses, political tracts and rude jokes.

Reas: “Like early twentieth-century collages built from the media of that time, and (comparable to) mid 20th century video collage, Signal to Noise fractures and distorts contemporary information into new data structure”.For Infinite Command Team, Reas developed a newer more evolved collage engine to create imagery: the video is completely abstract and moves at a rapid pace. However, rudiments of what remind the viewer of television images appear occasionally, and the speed with which animation and colour sequences change recalls quick channel-surfing. Infinite Command Team visually combines a familiar aesthetic of the modern age - television and the disruption or flicker of distorted signals or channels changed at high speeds - and contemporary computer generated animation.Casey Reas created Infinite Command Team in conjunction with 100% Gray Coverage, both 10 minutes in length and interlinked, utilising the same collage engine.","Casey Reas’ digital video-piece Infinite Command Team, exclusively available on Sedition, was derived from Reas’ work Signal to Noise.

An interference is an undesired disruption of an expected phenomenon. Interference Oscillations takes these two opposing points as its structural underpinning. A wave is intercepted by a varying array of geometric forms and pulses of colour; the constantly changing interplay between the forms and the line of the wave creates a dissonance.The work is a study of critical thresholds of sonic or light frequency and of the relationship between a fixed point and continuum. Low frequency events are easily differentiated as individual pulses or stripes, but as Shephard-Risset tones (sounds produced by the superposition of sine waves) are employed as infinite increases and decreases of pitch, timbre and rhythmic pulsing in order to create sonic doppelgängers of the visual moirés.The organised visual forms are repeatedly disturbed through the juxtaposition of chiral orthographic figures (deconstructed multistable Necker cubes) upon a ground which shifts between flat and dimensional referencing the screen, breaking its surface and rebuilding it.","A steady oscillation, or circular motion, is represented in physics as a perfect, infinite element.

These two pieces are at the extremes of Flaxton's practice - one is a moving image work that references Salvador Dali's painting of the Crucifixion of St John of the Cross, while the second is an abstract composition exploring the relationship between light and sound. Intersection of Dreams is a response to the effects on the young from older generations' curation of the planet’s resources. First exhibited as a triptych of screens, the work asks the viewer to gaze on the icon of hope and redemption for more than a billion of the world’s populace - the crucifixion of someone who continually gives their life to redeem our internal state. The viewer is at the same time being viewed by those that come after us, our children. Their gaze is not judgemental, they simply look at the viewer as they consider the familiar icon of hope. Slowly we proceed into the work and see that the figure of the crucifix is suspended over an intersection where traffic rushes to and fro. This is a nod to Dali, who  asks us to view the icon of the crucifix from an unfamiliar standpoint - we view from above looking down, from the position of a creator god who views both the redeemer of the world and the world that needs redeeming. This artwork asks us to consider the meaning not only of the images themselves, but the value of art in a world whose values are now deeply in question.These two works are the first of a series being launched to celebrate Flaxton's current exhibitions - the series is an opportunity for the collector to visit those exhibitions at a distance. It also highlights the diversity of Flaxton's practice, which incorporates two distinct, but interacting, practices of abstraction and realism.","Echoing Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition which are sketches of people, places, ideas and concepts, Sedition is releasing 2 works from exhibitions by Terry Flaxton, Intersection of Dreams, and Radiant Sound Radiant Light (Sonus et Lux Radiosa).

At times they envelop the frame, or disappear from view before straight edges momentarily emerge. The works feature a subtle piano soundtrack with varying lengths of pauses between notes that is inspired by Kepler’s planetary scale, which assigns a melody to each of the five planets known to science at the time, according to their speed of rotation and orbit.Tampon-Lajarriette follows this historical exploration of the connections between planetary orbits, musical scales, and geometric forms, using here the materiality and illusions of the digital image.

Karst,21,Snow Yunxue Fu,https://www.seditionart.com/snow-yunxue-fu/karst,"Karst is a limited edition recorded from a virtual reality experience as viewed by a user, creating a liminal space in between the representational and the theatrical, the limited and the multi-dimensional, and the abstract and the real. The work is inspired by Snow Yunxue Fu's personal childhood experiences of visiting the caves in her hometown in Southwest China. The memories and the impact of those experiences are still quite vivid, where the space feels both claustrophobic and expansive. The cave space embodies both aspects of natural formation and human intervention. On the one hand, the Karst caves are a display the formation of the rocks over a long period of time, much longer than any average civilization or human lifespan. The rock formations in the virtual scene are created using fluid simulation software, Realflow where water plays a natural role in sculpting the physical shapes of the caves along with the calcium accumulation over thousands of years. On the other hand, the caves are often lit up by artificial and saturated decorative lights; a decision made by the tourism department for groups of explorers to better see the breathtaking rock formations.In recent years, the Chinese government have found the conditions of the caves favourable for holding big data hardware as a naturally climate-controlled environment and other safety factors. While more and more personal data is now being stored inside the mountains of Fu's hometown, the artist felt the desire to recreate her childhood memories of the caves as a digital VR environment. The experience enables people to explore the caves and bring attention into the multi-layered digital nature of our contemporary human life. The spatial sound echoes in between the natural sounds in the cave and the hypothetical operational noises of machines. The experience in the digital cave attempts to embody the concept of the Plato’s cave in the medium of virtually contracted realm, providing a contemplative environment for the visitor to wonder; walking and teleporting within the control of the wireframed virtual hands that are given to them.Karst is a continuation of Fu’s artistic interests in creating virtual reality pieces that explore the idea of the techno sublime, relating to Chinese and Western landscape paintings, as well as the technological culture changing the way humans live in the contemporary technological culture.

The presence of the self and some tools – technicity – the making of meaning by humans though the invention of tools which then change their essential self is what art effectively is. Sensing or sighting something incoming, responding to this sense that there is something when most see nothing, and making a response, is the discharge that art is.”Flaxton, deep in the Australian bush, worked with the tools at his disposal to represent the landscape in an extraordinary way.

The Koh-i-Noor originated in India and belonged to various Indian and Persian rulers who fought bitterly over it at various points in history.

The cut of the single gem was not to European tastes, and it was split in two and under to guidance of Prince Albert. The crown and gems remain in the Tower of London. Locke’s work, Koh-i-Noor, depicts the Queen using various materials, with the hair mimicking rhododendrons, a Himalayan shrub common in stately homes and parks such as the Queen’s Scottish estate at Balmoral. He was also inspired by the landscapes in Indian miniature paintings of Maharajahs hunting on their estates.

When he returned home to the UK he created a new cinemontage work but was unhappy that the form did not fully represent his immersive  experience in the city because the emotion of the exchange was missing. In response to this, he abstracted all 200 images until they coalesced into a new form of the ‘Cartouche’ (meaning: a carved tablet or drawing representing a scroll with rolled-up ends, used ornamentally or bearing an inscription).

Last Supper Exploded,46,Yinka Shonibare,https://www.seditionart.com/yinka-shonibare/last-supper-exploded,"Yinka Shonibare MBE’s The Last Supper Exploded is based on a sculpture of the same name first on view at the artist’s solo show Pop! at Stephen Friedman Gallery, London, 2013. The exhibition’s main themes explored corruption, excess and debauchery in contemporary society, with particular reference to the most recent on-going economic crisis. In The Last Supper Exploded, Shonibare investigates the worship of luxury goods and the reckless behaviour of in particular the financial industry by paying art historical homage to one of humanity’s best known artworks: Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper.For the sculptural work, Shonibare MBE replaced the central figure of Christ with the Greek god of wine, Bacchus - a creature half-man, half-goat and symbolic of excess, frivolity, sexuality and animal instinct. Bacchus is surrounded by twelve beheaded disciples depicted in ludicrous and obscene positions, all wearing Shonibare’s trademark wax batik fabric in the form of tailored outfits - reminding the viewer of the artist’s on-going exploration of modern and colonial themes and their overlap; the removal of heads frequently featured in Shonibare’s practice is used to dissuade associations of race. Upon the table ranges a lavish display of exorbitance ranging from food to silverware, completing the image of a “Dionysiac climax of a pan-historical hedonistic party”.In Shonibare’s digital version of The Last Supper Exploded for Sedition, the artist animates his sculptures and raises the work’s visual impact to a further level of the grotesque. The figure of Christ - or Bacchus - is removed from the setting, the disciples rendered in almost naive computer anime but dressed in batik patterned clothes. The animation is accompanied by Mozart’s Eine kleine Nachtmusik*, with the music suddenly “sliced” by the sound of a cutting knife and liquid splashing: blood gushes from the open necks of the decapitated figures and splatters onto the walls and camera lens. The deliberately over-the-top scene evokes amusement rather than repulsion - the viewer is curious to explore this bizarre, excessive dinner party until it is impossible to see the scene depicted.Yinka Shonibare MBE lives and works in London.Music credits: Bruno Walter, conductor.

Lilith,65,Laura Jean Healey,https://www.seditionart.com/laura-jean-healey/lilith,"Lilith is the second film taken from the multi-channel digital installation, The (Un)Holy Trinity by Laura Jean Healey to celebrate International Women’s Day 2020.The (Un)Holy Trinity draws inspiration from three female characters either taken directly from the Bible, or inspired by the inconsistencies found within, to explore the deep-seated notion of the ‘fallen woman’.  Eve, Lilith and Salome - who through their supposedly unnatural acts of defiance, aggression, or desire for autonomy - have been demonised throughout history to serve as a warning as to how disruptive and destructive female sexuality can be if left unchecked. The three filmed performances seek to not only explore these women in their moment of defiance but, more importantly, to challenge the demonised perceptions of the so-called ‘unnatural’ woman - that have been used to warn women as to the dangers of such desires and/or actions.  Each of the films celebrate these women for their supposedly ‘unwomanly’ ways and draws upon the moment in which each woman asserts her own will; revealing her true inner strength in order to achieve her own sense of autonomy and defy the traditional, suffocating role that has been allotted to them throughout history.  By extension, the films seek to force the audience question why these ingrained perceptions still exist today.The second film focuses on the moment in which Lilith (Adam’s first wife according to Talmudic legend) refuses to submit to Adam.

Eve, Lilith and Salome - who through their supposedly unnatural acts of defiance, aggression, or desire for autonomy - have been demonised throughout history to serve as a warning as to how disruptive and destructive female sexuality can be if left unchecked. The three filmed performances seek to not only explore these women in their moment of defiance but, more importantly, to challenge the demonised perceptions of the so-called ‘unnatural’ woman - that have been used to warn women as to the dangers of such desires and/or actions.  Each of the films celebrate these women for their supposedly ‘unwomanly’ ways and draws upon the moment in which each woman asserts her own will; revealing her true inner strength in order to achieve her own sense of autonomy and defy the traditional, suffocating role that has been allotted to them throughout history.  By extension, the films seek to force the audience question why these ingrained perceptions still exist today.The second film focuses on the moment in which Lilith (Adam’s first wife according to Talmudic legend) refuses to submit to Adam.  This one act of rebellion results in Lilith being cast from paradise forever and in doing so becomes the succubus (a temptress of innocent men), the breeder of evil spirits, and a child-murdering monster of the night.

Light has the capacity to render virtually any solid subject intangible under the right perceptual conditions, and through his many projection mapping projects he uses light specifically to transform static, 2D, surfaces into dynamic objects that oscillate continually between the substantive to the ephemeral and back again. Subtle movements of lights, carefully describing pre-printed lines, shapes and forms, creates new images that ebb and flow, which in turn creates a new ""reading"" of the object and the space it inhabits. More importantly, the result is transcendent.","Liminal Landscape is a new video art series by Refik Anadol who works with light as his primary medium.

Set against a dense layer of black, it becomes impossible to reference anything of the world outside, artificial or otherwise. Thus what centres your imagination are these episodes of animation, in which a blue sphere of light appears and disappears, creating a point of entry and beneath it a point of exit, into and out of this transitory space that has the audience transfixed for a moment, deliberating over whether these clandestine creatures are falling into or out of a lesser predicament. The slick technological edge of this work comes with Schockmel’s signature use of a synthetic soundtrack that suggests that what might appear as one-dimensional, is fact a work of incredible depth and tonal atmosphere. The repetitive sequence of one mutation falling into this sliver of space and out of it, followed by another; returning between the two, becomes almost hypnotic as the illusion of unqualified space and unfathomable depth serves to illustrate just how well Schockmel creates these futuristic animations.

Lost Seconds explores the staged and constructed nature of the contemporary self and critically examines what society and the individual see and want to portray. What first appears like a regular self-choreographed performance reveals itself as a disturbing portrait of the female persona in a world dominated by attributes like attractiveness, quickly tipping into anxiety and narcissism, the artist having referred to Lost Seconds as a “melancholic portrait”.The work elevates the individual relationship with its socio-political environment to a recognisable and appealing set of behavioural actions of self-awareness and self-inflicted anguish. It is staged in the fashion of creating a self-image in the politically guarded societal arena of surveillance and social networks. In this media orientated process of constructing a self-image, one experiences the loss of one’s authenticity and identity over time.The focal point of the work the female protagonist sitting in the audience with minimal movement and action.

Magnetic Trap,35,Robin Fox,https://www.seditionart.com/robin-fox/magnetic-trap,"(Please be warned this video artwork contains flashing images.)Robin Fox’s digital version of his work Magnetic Trap, 2012, uses ‘tune data’ taken from the beam displacement of the Australian Synchrotron. The latter is a 3 GeV synchrotron radiation facility in Melbourne, Australia, and is a light source facility that uses particle accelerators to produce a beam of high energy electrons in order to create synchrotron light.

Malecon I,8,Donata Wenders,https://www.seditionart.com/donata-wenders/malecon-i,"Recalling the regal charm of Cuba’s capital city during the 1940s and 1950s, Donata Wenders evokes as much of its energy in her atmospheric image, Maleceon I (1998), as she does in the select narrative that accompanies the photograph. The main stretch of road, she recalls is “called Malecon at the shore of Havana” and is “hardly what it once was”; its cantankerous beauty resides in the relentless natural rhythm of a swell of water caressing the shore and spilling onto the concrete road. The water washes over everything in its wake as altering flows of pedestrians and cars criss-cross the thoroughfare adjacent to the ocean’s edge. In Wenders’ image, you see a landscape as much shaped by the industriousness of man as it is tempered by the vast sky and seascape that challenges the cityscape measure for measure.

Mandala,35,Shepard Fairey,https://www.seditionart.com/shepard_fairey/mandala,"Shepard Fairey has been dubbed one of the most influential street artists of our time. He aims for his work to reach the broadest audience possible, and as part of the 2010 art fair Art Basel Miami, he created a huge mural on a public building, Mandala Ornament.In this artwork Mandala, we see the design re-imagined, as each separate element of the surrounding pattern revolves around a central motif – the face of French wrestler Andre the Giant. The elaborately-ornate design continuously expands and contracts, while its core remains static, adding a slightly sinister undertone to this entrancing artwork.

Many Worlds,45,fuse*,https://www.seditionart.com/fuse/many-worlds,"In this scene called Many Worlds, three of the infinite possible configurations of a simulation that describes the development of our universe are shown. The parameters that define the physical characteristics of the system and the particles that move in this virtual space are changed at each iteration searching for a situation in which the conditions for the birth of life are met. The result of this process is a wide range of configurations in which the system show its ability to create or not variety and heterogeneity starting from the same quantity of matter.The title of this artwork is a tribute to the so-called Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by the American physicist Hugh Everett, according to which all possible alternative and future worlds are real, each representing an actual world. Before this theory, reality has always been seen as a single unfolding history. Many-worlds, on the other hand, sees historical reality as a tree with many branches where every possible quantum result is realized.","In this scene called Many Worlds, three of the infinite possible configurations of a simulation that describes the development of our universe are shown.

Masks,26,NONOTAK,https://www.seditionart.com/nonotak/masks,"Masks by NONOTAK are objects that are entirely without the use of technology, but appear as though they are engaged by it. Such props also serve to explain the orientation of the artist’s audiovisual experimentations. Using three layers of translucent plexiglass onto which they place layers of black or white stickers, the prevailing lines/designs are split into two parts, as the trim creates a separate geometric form, composing of one facade in order to hide another. The optical illusion of looking through pixelated glass into an adjoining space, creates this wonderfully abstract experience that might well resemble surrendering ourselves to a technological hub.For NONOTAK, the setting serves to alter our visual experience entirely by where we position ourselves in front of it. As they describe it: “when you are perfectly in front and centre of the piece, you only see the repeated lines, and when you move right and left you start noticing the geometric forms.” In context the texture of the intense patterned effect leads to a visual vibration that occurs from the repetition of the same pattern. As they intend to “generate a greater effect by making the work translucent, so its shadows can be displayed onto the wall”. As the plexiglass plates are translucent, the light and shadows go through the plates and are positively projected on the wall.

Over time, landscapes are gradually shaped by natural forces. Indiscernible to the naked eye, we are only able to experience one moment at a time. The fluctuations and the rhythmic movement of rivers are a glimpse into the past, as traces provide evidence of the constant transformations that surround us.The installation Meandering River is comprised of real-time visuals and music composed by an AI. The digital artwork reinterprets the shifting behaviour of rivers in the landscape as they contract and expand over the seasons. The sound composition was produced using the Google’s Magenta Performance RNN learning model and a custom-built procedural system and composed by Berlin creative studio Kling Klang Klong.Based on a bespoke algorithm, the rippling and oscillating movement inherent in thegenerated imagery provides a vantage point that transforms our understanding of progress,emphasising the power of natural forces as they alter landscapes over time. The rhythmic patterns of minor changes to riverbeds are not usually visible as they slowly happen over decades. Meandering River makes these rhythms visible and thereby leaves the observer with a humbling sense of the unpredictability of change and the beauty of nature.For Meander I, onformative leaves the visual connection to satellite imagery and landscapes behind to interpret the concept in a more discrete way, focusing on the meandering movements and visual potential inherent in this natural phenomenon.

The films that result from this documentation process are rapturous animations of narrative episodes. A man bathes, an airplane lands, a woman raps herself into a towel. The viewer is presented with an intimate display of the painter's trade and decision making process as Olivier exposes every change to his composition.Microbe falls into the stylistic category of some of Olivier's more recent large scale works that multilayer various different painterly processes in order to create an overall whole. We watch an abstract microcosmic world float, appear, and disappear. The various layers and elements of paint remind of minuscule forms of organic life. The cumulative levels of non-representational painting that drift over the screen heavily reference Gerhard Richter's Abstract Paintings - named by Olivier as one of his two favourite living artists.","Jacco Olivier (b. 1972) considers himself a painter.

In the work, Kay presents a 3D animated world in which complex cellular forms evolve and interact. The work is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Eric Betzig’s work on fluroescence mircoscopy, which made visible a groundbreaking picture of complex cellular processes and forms. In his homage to Bertzig, Kay worked with the scientist’s tomographic technique, which records biological processes using light-sheets. The artist then recreated these recordings as 3D simulations which were then used to extract final images for print. Microscopic Leaps was created out of these simulation experiments. The piece explores the self-reflective, exploratory, mundane and spectacular nature of simulations that are so intrinsic to the construction of scientific fact.","Microscopic Leaps is a short film produced by Markos Kay created exclusively for Sedition.

Miracle or Evil,48,Shezad Dawood,https://www.seditionart.com/shezad-dawood/miracle-or-evil,"British artist Shezad Dawood’s digital animation, Miracle or Evil, is based on a digitally modelled bust of Robert Anton Wilson (1932 – 2007), the American author and polymath who became, at various times, a novelist, essayist, philosopher, psychonaut, futurist, libertarian and self-described agnostic mystic. Conceived as a quantum portrait in honour of Wilson’s theories on quantum physics, the bust formally and conceptually draws on the futuristic endeavour to capture movement and multiple points of views, contained in Umberto Boccioni’s work (such as Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, 1913), and in the constructed sculptures of Naum Gabo, yet updated to present a vista of the future-past via contemporary technology. The 3D rendered bust was generated through an assemblage of Google images of Wilson at various times of his life, reflecting Dawood’s cinematic approach to non-linear time.","British artist Shezad Dawood’s digital animation, Miracle or Evil, is based on a digitally modelled bust of Robert Anton Wilson (1932 – 2007), the American author and polymath who became, at various times, a novelist, essayist, philosopher, psychonaut, futurist, libertarian and self-described agnostic mystic.

It is part of the project ""The Garden of Emoji Delights"" which includes a 13ft x 7ft digitally printed triptych that is a to-scale recreation, transcribed with Emoji symbols, of Hieronymus Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights.” One intention of the triptych was to mash up classic and contemporary sign systems, and to diversify and expand the emoji lexicon through this process. The large static piece is an homage to Bosch, and deeply tied in scale and physicality to the original. The subsequent videos that I have produced, like ""Monkeys and Angels"" here, allow me to be more dynamic with this hybrid visual vocabulary, and I can play more (and at times critique more), across time, with the slippage of signifiers. In the video vignettes, new allegorical narratives have emerged in response to the digital age in which we all coexist.Emoji are a contemporary glyph system which offer an emotional shorthand for virtual expression. Transcribing visual symbologies of an earlier era using Emoji makes perfect “nonsense-sense” to me, particularly with Bosch’s ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" in that his own visual style was so idiosyncratic and remarkably distinct in contrast to his peers.

Through the interplay of angles, surfaces, movement and sounds, Narcisse transforms, defines, merges and explores different kinds of space and spatiality.NONOTAK is a Paris-based studio created by illustrator Noemi Schipfer and musician Takami Nakamoto in 2011.

For this body of work, Cheung manipulates these visual reproductions in such a way that they almost respire, seemingly to breathe in and exhale out of nature into the realm of digital abstraction. The original images were taken from the open source collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Cheung processed each work with an open source code created by artist Kim Asendorf that ‘glitches’ the image using an algorithm to create over 4000 sequential images, where each work is ‘pixel-sorted’. This gives the illusion that the series of still life paintings are steadily dissolving into the digital sands of time. Historically the Dutch Golden Age was a period in which trade, science, and art flourished, where the Dutch masters were amongst the most celebrated in the world. It was an era that led to the birth of modern capitalism, the rise of the merchant classes, and the global exploitation of environmental resources for the development of nations and wider civilisations. In this period, Holland’s tulip bulbs traded at its peak for the equivalent price of a house, before the market collapsed in what was considered to be the first economic speculative bubble, otherwise known as 'Tulipomania'. The poignancy of a such a beautiful object bringing a nation to its knees due to collective madness of trade, set the tone for a global culture of boom and bust economics thereafter.The title of the series New Order also refers to the band of the same name, where one of its album covers for Power, Corruption and Lies designed by Peter Saville, which used a still life by Henri Fanton-Latour. Saville thought that the flowers “suggested the means by which power corruption and lies infiltrate our lives”.

New York Park Avenue Dial,34,Peter Newman,https://www.seditionart.com/peter-newman/new-york-park-avenue-dial,"Peter Newman’s time-lapse video New York Park Avenue Dial (2013) was shot at the foot of Mies van der Rohe’s monolithic Seagram Building. The work is part of a series of cityscapes that appear to positively celebrate Galileo’s 17th century assertion that the world is round, as a more conventional landscape is replaced by Newman’s self-styled spherical sequence showing New York in the early evening. To produce this technically accomplished work, Newman used a rare fish-eye lens that manages to take in a 220 degree view of the city with a single exposure. A world all of its own, Newman’s sphere is illuminated as much by the prevailing skyscrapers that puncture the dark blue sky as it is by the excitable movement of different coloured cars that wrap themselves around the outer diameter. The frenzied energy of the cars is enhanced by the subtle flickering of lights turning on and off in the outstretched glass buildings, and by the traces of airplanes shooting across the darkening sky above.","Peter Newman’s time-lapse video New York Park Avenue Dial (2013) was shot at the foot of Mies van der Rohe’s monolithic Seagram Building.

The piece is composed of  photographic fragments and geometric elements, arranged into complex patterns resulting in a trancelike, kaleidoscopic play of glinting sun and dark moon, landscape, shadow and light, as day gives way to night.Using digital special effects software such as After Effects, Sodeoka  produced Of Soil by manipulating still and moving images, as well as various combinations of filters to imitate natural optics. The soundtrack was made by Sodeoka’s long-time collaborator, MYMK.","Yoshi Sodeoka’s 2017 video work Of Soil explores the relationship between patterns in nature and infinity.

Here, the artist’s own lace-covered hand appears through the bare and pierced canvas, in effect ‘painting’ an image that appeals to the viewer, who perhaps ultimately joins their hand with hers.",Introverted,Intuitive,Feeling,Perceiving

Parallels,28,NONOTAK,https://www.seditionart.com/nonotak/parallels,"Parallels is an audiovisual installation by NONOTAK (Takami Nakamoto and Noemi Schipfer), originally commissioned by the STRP Biennial in Eindhoven. Following the success of their work in the Glow Next light art festival in November 2014, NONOTAK returned to Eindhoven with a new work. As with all of NONOTAK’s installations, Parallels explores light as a substantive material, but on this occasion, space as a whole becomes their panoramic screen. Referring to their installation series, Daydream, the boundaries and notion of space become entirely abstracted by the interrelated presence of an audience, who upon entering into the work, interrupt the seamless blades of lights, creating a biomorphic shapes of their own. In situ this installation responses entirely to the space in which it takes place, as it lives within it. As soon as the light hits the walls that define the space, it reaches its limit and is unable to reproduce itself any further.Parallels is inspired by British artist Anthony McCall’s exploration of light and space. The space is entirely submerged into a layer of fog that is produced by two haze machines controlled via DMX, in order to maintain a specific density and quality of atmosphere. What proves incredibly engaging in this work is the installation’s ability to create 3-dimensional forms using 2-dimensional visuals. This effect leads to a series of vertical lines becoming curtains of light that the audience are able to move into and through. Generated by seven light projectors that allow the artists the ability to work on gradients of black and white. Crucially when the series of blades of illumination are in motion, they allude to the theatrical space beyond. The name Parallels derives from using only lines as visual matter, allowing for a varieties of geometric light enhanced forms born of interrelated lines. NONOTAK have created Parallels as a digital edition of the audiovisual installation for Sedition.

Pareidolia I,25,Matthew Biederman & Pierce Warnecke,https://www.seditionart.com/matthew-biederman-and-pierce-warnecke/pareidolia-i,"Pareidolia I is the first audiovisual work in the Perspection series by Matthew Biederman and Pierce Warnecke. The piece uses colour, frequency, and noise to work in and around the different thresholds of perception of  basic audiovisual elements.Extremely high and low frequencies on the threshold of human hearing are used to illustrate that sound (as heard by humans) emerges from infinitely complex oscillations. By focusing on either end of the audible spectrum, the sonic vacuum between the extremes replaces the space where one expects to hear sound – the lack of noise is heard through the noise. Visually the work builds upon the 'Phi Phenomenon' defined by Max Wertheimer, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology, which describes the perception of still images viewed in quick succession as continuous images – the very basis upon which film and video appear as moving images. Through generative layerings of unconnected still imagery, the work creates an illusion of motion as shapes, patterns and movements emerge out of chaos.","Pareidolia I is the first audiovisual work in the Perspection series by Matthew Biederman and Pierce Warnecke.

That by virtue of its mutation redresses a continent’s social and cultural movement, where one after another a new generation up and leave their street and state, in pursuit of loftier ambitions. Captured in the series as candid portraits of people leaving and returning like seasonally migrating birds. Having previously conceived of the term Punjabi Baroque as the aesthetic undertone for India’s new middle classes, Thukral and Tagra have gathered their visual motifs as though contemporary ethnographers. Deliberately deconstructing the lives of their contemporaries, as they sought to understand what effect the social disconnect between siblings and parents has upon the nucleus of a family, and of its influence upon streets and cities. “One of the main themes of this body of works is about Punjabi’s who migrate to Canada and America, who want to fly abroad and resettle. And what they bring back is actually a new kind of aesthetic. Which you can see absorbed into the food, fashion, and their habitable spaces. And this effects and influences the architecture of new parts of India.” Such circumstances see this country as having to absorb new narratives that reflect the elasticity and energies of its modern population. “We grew up with the general acknowledgement that most Indians dream of leaving the country and moving abroad. Both our families come from the northern Indian state of Punjab, where the desire to immigrate has always been extremely common. After travelling to one of these countries, either for schooling or employment, Punjabi men often find themselves rather isolated and stick close to their own community.”Phantom XI – B appears like a kitsch billboard, conjuring an extreme sense of modernity, as its portrait of an individual is representative of those seeking economic and social improvement. Beginning as a still image, closer to a photograph, Thukral & Tagra’s pink t-shirted turbaned man begins to engage in a routine of mildly amusing actions, that subtly and very effectively demonstrates his will to want to move from the moment, and more robustly away from his prescribed cultural destiny. Which as a notion has this artistic pairing aestheticise over the perishables.

The artist choses a subject that he paints in thick expressive brush strokes. He then reworks the painting in shape, colour, and form repeatedly. Every stage of this process is recorded meticulously with photography, after which the latter creates the final work: a sequenced film that shows the physical work's development. Pike, 2012, is a typical sample of Olivier's work: we see a pike hover in what appears to be an underwater world. Both fish and surrounding continuously metamorphose before our eyes as the artist records every change he makes to the canvas. The resulting film presents the viewer with a window into a microcosm of every-day life that is obscured by the coincidently complex conception of the image. Olivier's work manages to fuse tradition and modernity into a whole new creative form of expression: one of the most classic forms of artistic expression (oil painting) pairs with a quintessentially modern medium (film), producing a digital artwork that references not only the painterly process but art history's narrative itself.

This new, unusual device is a hybrid of a leech and a smartphone; it feeds on the blood of the owner, thereby maintaining its working capability: simultaneously it collects medical data (e.g.,monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, carrying out blood tests); if necessary, it can synthesize various substances, such as insulin, and introduce them into the blood of the owner.All the data collected is integrated into a single cloud-based data system about your health. It includes data obtained in other institutions, private clinics, dentists’ offices and other specialists. The data is analyzed by the latest self-learning software based on artificial intelligence. The result of this analysis is a regular Update, which is sent to PiO, and it, in turn, produces the necessary substances in its body and injects them into your bloodstream.We have added two eye-cameras in the updated version so that you can make video calls and participate in video chats and conferences.Thus, your body is under constant unobtrusive observation and gentle care, and your mind is always in touch with the information universe!","Without noticing it, a person lives in symbiosis with many microorganisms that make up the flora of their intestines and skin.

This new, unusual device is a hybrid of a leech and a smartphone; it feeds on the blood of the owner, thereby maintaining its working capability: simultaneously it collects medical data (e.g.,monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, carrying out blood tests); if necessary, it can synthesize various substances, such as insulin, and introduce them into the blood of the owner.All the data collected is integrated into a single cloud-based data system about your health. It includes data obtained in other institutions, private clinics, dentists’ offices and other specialists. The data is analyzed by the latest self-learning software based on artificial intelligence. The result of this analysis is a regular Update, which is sent to PiO, and it, in turn, produces the necessary substances in its body and injects them into your bloodstream.We have added two eye-cameras in the updated version so that you can make video calls and participate in video chats and conferences.Thus, your body is under constant unobtrusive observation and gentle care, and your mind is always in touch with the information universe!",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Judging
Plasma,40,Frederik De Wilde,https://www.seditionart.com/frederik-de-wilde/plasma-20,"Plasma is an audiovisual artwork by Frederik De Wilde which explores the phenomenon of plasma (from Ancient Greek πλάσμα, meaning 'moldable substance'), one of the four fundamental states of matter, which was first described by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s. It consists of a gas of ions – atoms which have some of their orbital electrons removed – and free electrons. Neon signs and lightning are examples of partially ionized plasmas. The Earth's ionosphere is a plasma and the magnetosphere contains plasma in the Earth's surrounding space environment. The interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionized plasma, along with the solar corona and stars. Plasma may be the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter. Plasma is mostly associated with stars, extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.","Plasma is an audiovisual artwork by Frederik De Wilde which explores the phenomenon of plasma (from Ancient Greek πλάσμα, meaning 'moldable substance'), one of the four fundamental states of matter, which was first described by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.

Each keystroke forces a change of camera angle as only human errors in each of the transcribed paragraphs permit a view of what is being typed. The work is structured not around the narrative as contained in the text, but rather around the process of applying ink to paper via the pressing of keys.Post creates a dissonance between the way we expect information formatting to be represented, and the way information formatting is produced. This dissonance invites a questioning of the way history is an actively produced narrative. While developing the work Shovlin was interested in how anonymous editorial contributes to a reader’s focus of a text – each text was chosen as it had been underlined or highlighted by a previous reader of the book.

Postcards from Beijing,48,Terry Flaxton,https://www.seditionart.com/terry-flaxton/postcards-from-beijing,"Postcards from Beijing is a video work by Terry Flaxton shot in Tian Tan Park, the Temple of Heaven on a Sunday in the summer when time stands still in a particular way. Sensing this, the artist’s only response is to place a camera without thinking, and allowing constructions of moments to occur on their own. For Flaxton, it is important not to compose the image, but to allow the image to compose itself. In perfect synchronisation with the ‘Tao’, the moment inscribes itself within the image in a particular kind of way. Only if the self is subdued will the Tao measure the essence of the entwining of the dragon and the tiger such that their energies are enabled to become manifest. Those that view the result of this energetic exchange must not judge, nor interpret, as they too subdue the self.","Postcards from Beijing is a video work by Terry Flaxton shot in Tian Tan Park, the Temple of Heaven on a Sunday in the summer when time stands still in a particular way. Sensing this, the artist’s only response is to place a camera without thinking, and allowing constructions of moments to occur on their own.

Pound,48,Mary Katrantzou,https://www.seditionart.com/mary_katrantzou/pound,"In an exciting collaboration with Sedition, Mary Katrantzou has created her first digital artwork. The Greek fashion designer with a background in architecture and a textile design degree from Central Saint Martins is best known for her exceptional print designs that characterize her ready-to-wear collections. She transcribes themes onto fabric that accumulate into a visual play of illusions: objects mirror each other in obscured proportions and create a fascinating and fantastic world of colour and beauty.For Pound, Katrantzou uses a similar system as when creating her textiles: she chooses an unwearable object - a pound note - and makes it the central theme of her design. She appropriates, changes and plays with it until it generates a completely new form. Pound is a collage of many fragments of English pound notes that are fused into a magical whole that is then animated according to the rules of a kaleidoscope. We watch as the screen before us explodes again and again in new and surprising shapes and forms. The effect is hypnotic, fascinating, and stunningly beautiful all at once.","In an exciting collaboration with Sedition, Mary Katrantzou has created her first digital artwork.

Presence is the result of an intense collaboration between Universal Everything, choreographer Benjamin Millepied and his LA Dance Project.However, it required a delicate balance between abstraction and the figurative to create an artificial form whose movement feels alive, not synthetic. Using motion-track technology, dancer’s movements were captured as they performed choreographed dances following strict structural rules, based on a rhythmic pulse. Subsequently, the footage was manipulated and abstracted into animated sculptural forms that only hint at their origins: the chamber-like space of the screen fills with an immersive, rhythmic, ever-changing audio-visual performance - alive with primal expressions of gestural drawing and choreography. Colour scheme and abstraction follow rules like ‘faster movement equals stronger colours, smaller movements cause colour to recede’, and so on; and in order to keep the focus on form, bursts of colour only fill the space in response to audio-peaks of the soundtrack.The Presence series consists of 24 films created from six separate dance sequences - each with four variations. It is a work about contemporary technology and its almost limitless possibilities; the beauty it can contribute to everyday lives. Pyke: “I wanted to find the harmony and tension between drawing architecture, human movements, CGI and interaction.

The rotation of the diamond evokes the rotating doors of a traditional hotel, part adventure, part sanctuary.

Through the careful arrangement of iconic imagery, the project confronts head on the contemporary overexposure and indifference to conflict and brutality. By exposing lessons unlearned the project looks unflinchingly at the fallibility of humankind and asks what morality is in today’s society.The digital edition of Reconciliation created specially for Sedition, derives from a sculpture inspired by two seemingly divergent yet iconic historical milestones: the Holocaust and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

The piece accompanies an exhibition, Reconciliation, in London in December 2016 and a subsequent exhibition in New York. The exhibition will feature sculptural works, prints and videos, including an interview with the Holocaust survivor who lent the use of his story and prisoner number to the project.

Eve, Lilith and Salome - who through their supposedly unnatural acts of defiance, aggression, or desire for autonomy - have been demonised throughout history to serve as a warning as to how disruptive and destructive female sexuality can be if left unchecked.The three filmed performances seek to not only explore these women in their moment of defiance but, more importantly, to challenge the demonised perceptions of the so-called ‘unnatural’ woman - that have been used to warn women as to the dangers of such desires and/or actions.  Each of the films celebrate these women for their supposedly ‘unwomanly’ ways and draws upon the moment in which each woman asserts her own will; revealing her true inner strength in order to achieve her own sense of autonomy and defy the traditional, suffocating role that has been allotted to them throughout history.  By extension, the films seek to force the audience question why these ingrained perceptions still exist today.The third film draws upon the moment when Salome (the young princess of Judea in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew and later the focus of Oscar Wilde’s tragedy Salome (1891)) tastes the blood of John the Baptist - after dancing seductively for her uncle/stepfather - in one final desperate attempt to posses him mind, body and soul.  While her uncle, who killed his brother, married his sister in law and covets the body of his own niece/step-daughter goes unpunished, it is Salome’s more dominant, ‘masculine’ sexuality that ultimately leads to her being punished for her “monstrous” nature.  It is her inherently violent and sexual nature that has been used to not only caution women against the destructive power of female seduction, but to also serve as a warning as to the dangers such ‘unwomanly’ desires and actions may lead to.

Sanctus,28,Terry Flaxton,https://www.seditionart.com/terry-flaxton/sanctus,"Sanctus is the first part released from Terry Flaxton’s A Digital Requiem which is a series of audio-visual works created for Sedition. The music for Sanctus was recorded by sonic artist Emily Burridge in Chartres Cathedral, France, and is a sound composition taken from an improvisation by the cellist whilst working in that space. Flaxton visually creates both an exterior and interior space for Burridge’s composition to work within. Here Flaxton alludes to the power of the space where the piece was recorded, through the use of images of trees whose forms are echoed in the architecture of the Corinthian columns of Chartres. This counterpoint, interior space and exterior space, analogue space and digital space, manufactured and natural space are woven together in Sanctus as an interconnecting practice which speaks about the relationship of the analogue and the digital at this point in time, and their future relationship to the quantum age. Recent quantum work proposes that instead of being eternally real, the world comes into being and goes out of being between every moment produced in time/space. The eternal underlying evidence of the presence of the ‘sanctus’ or spirit of sanctuary is what Flaxton’s work alludes to.Further pieces in A Digital Requiem will be collaborations with different sonic artists from traditional instrumentalists to electronic composers. As a whole Flaxton's Requiem aims to anticipate what is to come in the quantum age.","Sanctus is the first part released from Terry Flaxton’s A Digital Requiem which is a series of audio-visual works created for Sedition.

Seeding,32,Shu Lea Cheang,https://www.seditionart.com/shu-lea-cheang/seeding,"In certain parts of the world, vast farmlands have been colonised by genetically modified crops for our staple foods (i.e. wheat, soybeans, and corn). Introduced thirty years ago, the transgenic biotechnology has since been commercialised by the patent-protected corporate sectors. Taking over the wholesale markets, the herbicide-tolerant and pest-resistant seeds promise higher yields and profits without much ecological concerns. In recent years, the European Union has considered the adoption of a new seeds policy which favours the corporate seeds industry; making all seeds subject to strict regulation. It is feared that such legislation could hurt organic varieties and prevent seed exchange by farmers and savers.Shu Lea Cheang’s digital edition Seeding (2015) derives from Seeds Underground (2013), which is both a web interface and a public performance project where seed exchange parties are held. The work, turns the text from original court document from the Supreme Court of the United States, Vernon Hugh Bowman v. Monsanto case, a legal case involving the infringement of a seed patent by the former of the latter (held in Washington, D.C. on 19 February 2013). In the piece, the individual letters from the document dissolve, and finally reappear as ever-replicating seeds. The seeds are symbolically transmitted by a divine wind and then distributed by human/machine power across the vast virtual farmland. Seeding is a powerful gesture towards the detriments of patents on organic farming and the desire for the liberation of seeds.","In certain parts of the world, vast farmlands have been colonised by genetically modified crops for our staple foods (i.e. wheat, soybeans, and corn). Introduced thirty years ago, the transgenic biotechnology has since been commercialised by the patent-protected corporate sectors. Taking over the wholesale markets, the herbicide-tolerant and pest-resistant seeds promise higher yields and profits without much ecological concerns. In recent years, the European Union has considered the adoption of a new seeds policy which favours the corporate seeds industry; making all seeds subject to strict regulation. It is feared that such legislation could hurt organic varieties and prevent seed exchange by farmers and savers.Shu Lea Cheang’s digital edition Seeding (2015) derives from Seeds Underground (2013), which is both a web interface and a public performance project where seed exchange parties are held. The work, turns the text from original court document from the Supreme Court of the United States, Vernon Hugh Bowman v. Monsanto case, a legal case involving the infringement of a seed patent by the former of the latter (held in Washington, D.C. on 19 February 2013). In the piece, the individual letters from the document dissolve, and finally reappear as ever-replicating seeds. The seeds are symbolically transmitted by a divine wind and then distributed by human/machine power across the vast virtual farmland.

This piece examines both portraiture and self-portraiture.In this work, the famous oil painting Triumph of the Marine Venus, by Sebastiano Ricci (1659 - 1734), is transformed into polygonal warps, thanks to a process of patient and digital weaving work. The analogical nature of the original source image acquires the immortality and multiplicity of infinite vectorial resolution and digital reproducibility.Fini then applied the same procedure to the manipulation of her own image: “suddenly a self-portrait becomes a self-destruction process, where it is the hand of the portrayed that deforms and warps the final artwork, sadistically pulling away vectors and edges.”","Self Portrait with Venus is one of four video works by Francesca Fini in the Su Misura collection, which explores the concept of contemporary identity by combining digital image-making and manipulation with historic portraiture.

Sense,50,Jenny Holzer,https://www.seditionart.com/jenny_holzer/sense,"Since the late 1970s, Jenny Holzer has used language and many forms of address to examine society, beliefs, and the spaces in which an individual finds herself. From anonymous street posters to electronic signs, from stone benches to light projections, Holzer's materials suggest a landscape spilling over with connotations, information, propaganda and politics. Her texts—thirteen series written from 1977 to 2001—place the individual in that teeming landscape with language that speaks to the commonality of love, disaster, death, optimism, fear and desire. Sense is a reincarnation of Holzer's earliest series, Truisms (1977-79).While the texts variously scroll, unfurl and lunge across the screen, a range of voices recites the writing. A child's voice declaims something ageless but not at all pure. A man's voice veers between the mechanized and the declarative.  Viewers might lose a  sense of truth, sincerity, and originality and question the validity of the statements or they might subscribe.Holzer wrote the Truisms as a compilation of one-liners to resemble existing maxims or cliches. Each truism distills difficult and contentious ideas into what seems to be a straightforward fact. The Truisms were first shown on anonymous street posters that Holzer pasted throughout downtown Manhattan.

Simple Harmonic Motion #2,26,Memo Akten,https://www.seditionart.com/memo-akten/simple-harmonic-motion-2,"Memo Akten’s Simple Harmonic Motion works are part of an ongoing research series investigating complexity through simplicity: to explore the nature of complex patterns created from the interaction of simple multilayered rhythms. Custom software creates a number of ‘agents’ who are assigned a simple behaviour - a repetitive pattern of movement and sound. On its own, each agent is monotonous and mechanical. However, in combination with other agents, the interaction of the various parts creates an encompassing audiovisual experience. Akten drew inspiration for the project when exploring the motion of pendulums and other fundamental oscillatory phenomena that exhibit simple harmonic motion. In addition, drew on the works of Norman Mclaren, John Whitney, Steve Reich, John Cage, Gyorgi Ligeti, Edgar Varese and Brian Eno.Simple Harmonic Motion continually evolves and takes shape in various media, ranging from video to sound installation.

There was no shelter so I roasted in the heat. After one twelve minute shot, I had to move on. I found a spot with a clear view of Midtown, the Empire State in the centre of the shot. There was constant activity on the river so I am really looking forward to seeing the footage. After about twenty minutes of filming an old guy sitting on a bench nearby said to me “dis your hobby?” in a broad New Jersey accent. “No, work” I replied. “Some job” he said after a very long pause, and you know, he had a point.""This is  the first work in the series exploring horizontal lines in the natural world.

The collection is inspired by the concept of a ‘wetware’ computer, a computer composed of organic material.Many of the prototype wetware computers developed so far have been built using neurons. Unlike the conventional binary on-off configuration used in computing, neurons are capable of switching between thousands of states, meaning wetware computers have the potential to be far more dynamic and self-organising than conventional computers.

Produced using a combination of analogue and digital techniques, the work displays a tension between stability and disruption.  An ordered image is challenged by an intense pulsing interference. Hard-edged forms and intense colours slip over one another in a state of frenzied flux. The work is a progressive evolution towards more ambiguous symmetrical imagery. Such disruptive intervention draws the attention to the intangible signals and impulses which subtly infiltrate daily life – creating the possibility to visualise and engage with technologies in alternative ways.","As a work LoVid’s Slow Quilt (2015)  appears to dissolve into a hypnotic state of flux.

Laid bare in a forensic-like setting, Haudressy’s simulated heart is starkly devoid of all of its associated body parts, as it appears delicately suspended by a mesh of impenetrable thread that has enveloped it entirely. When animated, the transparent organ elegantly vacillates as it would were blood pumping through its chambers - beating beneath an elastic membrane of jagged lines that stretches with every detail of movement. The work can be likened to a virus that has taken hold, as the heart appears as restricted as it is animated. With the moving image acting unpredictably, as a calculated set of contours appear and disappear in a state of generative flux, it makes for a compelling composition of technology and tenderness; one upon the other.","Pascal Haudressy’s digital edition Somewhere We Will Meet Again (White Version) is derived from a series of video works featuring internal organs from the human body; including the heart, lungs, and brain.

SoN01R,31,Frederik De Wilde,https://www.seditionart.com/frederik-de-wilde/son01r,"SoN01R is a new media artwork by Frederik De Wilde in collaboration with Frederik Vanhoutte. The work uses dynamic artistic data visualisation and sonification to explore the quantum vacuum. It responds to the question “how can one visualise something as immaterial, short lived and universal as quantum fluctuations?” In classical physics (applicable to macroscopic phenomena), empty space-time is called the vacuum. The classical vacuum is utterly featureless. However, in quantum mechanics (applicable to microscopic phenomena), the vacuum is a much more complex entity. It is far from featureless and far from empty. Quantum fluctuations are the temporary appearance of energetic particles out of nothing, as allowed by the Uncertainty Principle. For example, a particle pair can pop out of the vacuum during a very short time interval, and then annihilate one another in accordance with the Uncertainty Principle.SoN01R uses a real-time data feed from the Australian National University’s Department of Quantum Science led by Dr. Thomas Seymul, which records quantum behaviour. By tapping into a physical quantum source the department can generate true random numbers in real-time; these in turn  drive the audiovisual work. SoN01R demonstrates that something can be generated out of (almost) nothing in the quantum vacuum.","SoN01R is a new media artwork by Frederik De Wilde in collaboration with Frederik Vanhoutte.

Underlying the works resonance is Fang Lu’s political intention that motives her to locate the work between the cradles of consumerism and communism. As the rhythmic commotion of the modern metropolis provides the backdrop for Fang Lu’s guttural screaming. That can be heard coming from deep inside the overnight bag, as though the artist herself is trapped inside the fabric case. And as a mild melee of shoppers pass over the steel bridge, back and forth, Fang Lu’s provocative and prolonged outcry spreads a mysterious aura of unease over this otherwise ordinary evening.

Sovereign State,42,Hew Locke,https://www.seditionart.com/hew-locke/sovereign-state,"Growing up in Guyana, Hew Locke remembers images of Queen Elizabeth II on his school exercise book covers remaining long after the country’s Independence. As children, he and his friends would get into trouble for defacing the symbols of the monarchy by playfully giving her spectacles or a moustache. More seriously, Locke’s current work challenges the dearth of more complex images of the royal family and instead creates images with a very different truth as art. Elizabeth II is somebody who for Locke, holds 60 years worth of political secrets in her head; declaring that he wouldn't wish to know all the things she knows. In this video work, Sovereign State, Locke has shown her mouth bound; to hold everything in. Sounds of whispers hover in the air as the images of the Queen transform slowly from one to the other. Edvard Munch’s famous 1893 painting The Scream is a significant influence, as are Tudor portraits of Elizabeth I by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.  These include The Rainbow Portrait in which she wears a dress covered in eyes and ears as the all-seeing ruler, and The Ditchley Portrait, where she stands upright on a map of England; storms raging behind her while the sun shines before her. Locke’s contemporary take on the monarchy references medieval and renaissance imagery of the ruling elite, who were often portrayed with skulls or skeletons as a reminder that “in the midst of life we are in death” and thus change is always inevitable.","Growing up in Guyana, Hew Locke remembers images of Queen Elizabeth II on his school exercise book covers remaining long after the country’s Independence.

The refraction of light produces colours and lines that rotate within a dreamscape, as if one is drifting in and out of reality.The work was created using digital 3D animation techniques, accompanied by sounds produced using an electric guitar that were then modified to create an otherworldly ambient soundtrack. Once the soundtrack was complete the artist used software to analyse the frequencies of sound produced by the guitar and used the resulting data to control the subtle motion and colours of the light rays seen in the piece. The  light rays were carefully adjusted to create a shifting experience of light and space as if floating within an alternate dimension.","Spectrum Discord: Number 0 is a video artwork by artist and musician Yoshi Sodeoka.

The work is part of the Cornea collection of three works which explore digital vision and image-making.Family, nature and scenes of human panic - that may have been real or imaginary - are composed in an elusive loop where images fall into each other, following the unfathomable logic of a dream. The shifts in perception unfold an unimaginable surface under the banal, exploring perceptions of what seems an increasingly fractured world of 'fake news' and 'post truth'. To create the work, the artist combined shots from his daughter's birthday, family trips and mass media news into an associative yet developing sequence, and then broke the video's digital compression to achieve fluidity of time and space. The texture of the video seems at times like an oil painting, and fragmented to pieces. The realistic source footage turns in this work into a vision of the mind, as a subjective experience, deforming the light rays reaching human eyes. It’s cognitive processing -  as code processing, revealing further layers in, under and around the immediate see-able texture. Image is perception. We construct the meaning of ourselves.

Kahn joins 3D scanning and printing with traditional casting techniques and creates works that resemble de-constructed monuments hiding between the futuristic and antiquity. Her sculptures and 3D animations speak of the impossibility of ever capturing more than a trace of the past or a fraction of a living breathing body: the scanning technology deployed by Kahn is not designed to represent the human form, and hence, it can only generate fragmented results from the conflicting spatial coordinates it receives, resulting in a ‘3D motion blur’.  Synthetic Statues is a prime example of the artist’s work and illustrates her concern with death in the still image, highlighted by the interaction of new and old media and the collision of the human body with imaging technology. The fragmented bodies of Synthetic Statues are neither complete figuration nor total abstraction; neither entirely futuristic nor classical.

Temple I,50,Georg Jagunov,https://www.seditionart.com/georg-jagunov/temple-i,"Georg Jagunov’s Temple video works focuses on a number of animated architectural structures that for the majority are submerged in heavy shadow. Reflecting upon time as a mode of machinery, Jagunov’s darkened animation represents for the artist a bridge between higher heaven, earth, and the underworld. In Temple I, what appears to be isolated elevators scale the length of two towers, shuttling their contents to their next destination. The Temple series of carefully constructed collages are made up of many photographs and video fragments collected by Jagunov whilst traveling. The collection’s title Hierarchy of Concealment is a phrase from Arata Isozaki’s book Japan-ness In Architecture, in which he refers to Ise Jingu, the most holy shrine of Shinto religion, which is completely rebuilt every twenty years following a series of secret rituals.","Georg Jagunov’s Temple video works focuses on a number of animated architectural structures that for the majority are submerged in heavy shadow.

Temple II,50,Georg Jagunov,https://www.seditionart.com/georg-jagunov/temple-ii,"In Georg Jagunov’s Temple II, a stencilled archway acts as the central structure of this haunting work, as an ambiguous architectural structure partially hidden in darkness. This configuration appears entirely removed from reality. As the cave induced soundtrack punctuates the animation, so this incomplete turret dissolves into the darkness, drip by drip. Submerged in darkness, the forms become lines, marks and pulsing lights that rise and fall, hinting at an underlying machinic structure. Jagunov effectively creates a backdrop of weighted silence from which his forms emerge to quietly interrogate the emergence and composition of image and the metaphysical passage of time.","In Georg Jagunov’s Temple II, a stencilled archway acts as the central structure of this haunting work, as an ambiguous architectural structure partially hidden in darkness.

Temple VIII,50,Georg Jagunov,https://www.seditionart.com/georg-jagunov/temple-viii,"Georg Jagunov’s work Temple VIII, is dark, shadowy and contemplative. Biblical towers emerge like beacons from lightless scenes; the focal point evokes, but does not fully emerge as, a curved vault or dome. The ghostly structure rises from – or is layered into – an indecipherable darkness which suggests concealment, blanketing or perhaps elimination. The forms that emerge from the darkness could constitute a monument, an imprint or an alien. To these partial or emerging building blocks, Jagunov  applies softly flickering lights which hint at something beyond this abandon of black. Taking inspiration from the lights on the rooftop of the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, Jagunov applies a faint flicker of light to his works of the series as testament to an evidence of life.","Georg Jagunov’s work Temple VIII, is dark, shadowy and contemplative.

The concept for Terms & Conditions Apply is a metaphor for the 'Anthropocene', a term that marks a new era whereby the human species triggers a permanent shift in the ecosystem, the natural world and its evolutionary processes.

Terpsichore,33,John Sanborn,https://www.seditionart.com/john-sanborn/terpsichore,"Terpsichore is part of The Anesthesia Quartet, a collection of four video works by John Sanborn. The works explore the formation of self - the concepts that tie us to an idea of self and the everyday challenges we must face to maintain a sense of self. The works express self as both a fragile construct requiring constant work and a powerful structure through which to navigate and process the world.As we drift away from our innate connection to nature, putting our faith in robots and a “post-human” future, one wonders how we will find salvation on short notice. A tree planted 20 years ago will today be taller than any being that planted it, and will eventually survive every single soul.This work proves there is hope in a alliance of body and landscape. It embraces getting lost in the minimalism of being alive as exemplified by a palindrome of gesture. Redemption is just a few keystrokes away - starting with an imprint of duality followed by tracing the ritual of human repetition.As we listen to music, the brain allocates resources usually taken up by basic sensory processes to strengthen connectivity in other networks that are responsible for emotion processing and integration of information.When we watch a body in motion, we respect the laws of gravity as we connect with our base instincts of fight or flight.

The dramatic sky with its rays of light spilling into the ocean seems to be pulling the helicopter down into an abyss. And yet, simultaneously, we can not help but wonder whether Wenders intended us to see the machine itself as the source of light that tips its luminescence over the quiet landscape below.The image creates a paradoxical interplay of stillness at the tip of movement and suspense within a context of serenity. The Chopper was photographed by Wenders in 2005 when travelling through Japan.","Wim Wenders' The Chopper is iconic of the artist's ability to unleash a viewer's imagination: the image is like a story yet to come, where the bare trace of human life - the hovering helicopter in the sky - makes us speculate about the moment in time that the photograph was taken.It is difficult to determine whether the helicopter is subject or object of the scene we see.

The Consciousness of Trees,10,Terry Flaxton,https://www.seditionart.com/terry-flaxton/the-consciousness-of-trees,"The Consciousness of Trees is the culmination of an inquiry into drawing, inscription & abstraction. One of the simplest acts an artist can make is the direct hand/eye coordination that is the series of marks on paper called ‘a drawing’ (within Portraits of New York, available on Sedition, there is a attempt to refine the image down to ‘the line’). In Drawings and Inscriptions, also available on Sedition, the idea that inscription may only happen in a durable material is interrogated within a medium that could be argued is ephemeral.In these works, abstraction goes beyond figuration to formulate a symbolic or conceptual language that transcends anthropocentric mark making. With this work there is a step-change up from abstraction because there is no intention to utilize mark-making to depict a concept via visual reference within the work (though these may be found inside the work). The intention here is to go beyond symbolic or allegorical processes to evoke a new function of ‘entrainment’ between artwork and viewer. Here, Flaxton is interested in exploring what he imagines to be the ‘consciousness’ of trees. Here he is proposing a different way to interpret a subject than that which is offered by drawing, inscription or abstraction.","The Consciousness of Trees is the culmination of an inquiry into drawing, inscription & abstraction.

Yearly the Mexican community gathers to assert its essential life energy in a festival of the night - when mysterious entities and unknown phenomena come alive. Terry Flaxton first came to photography in 1971 and by 1976 had captured many portraits of the abandoned, the discarded in society, and those who seemed to have cast themselves outside its boundaries of their own volition. In 1977 he went to California to record those who suffered this fate on the Western edge in US society. On his return, he deep-tank developed 30 rolls of traditional film stock that had been shot on an Olympus OM10 only to learn that the developer was contaminated, ruining all but one of the films. He abandoned photography at that moment. 42 years later, suddenly in an ecstatic engagement over a two-hour period, he re-engaged with the photographic form. This happened because a series of inner portraits began to reveal themselves as the image formed on the screen; the interior life of each person was first exposed, then manifested. Importantly, all of the people depicted in this series have their faces covered with make-up – as if a covering of their natural form would then allow a reveal of their character that could not occur where the face was seen without make-up – without a masque. The treatment that Flaxton chose in the moment of capture, reveals something that is not easily seen - the interplay between the masque, the exterior construct, and the ephemeral inner world.The images in The Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) were captured on an iPhone Pro 11.","The Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) was created at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery at the beginning of November 2019.

Upon a closer look, it oscillates between two appropriated portraits of Pope Innocent X—one painted by the Irish twentieth century artist Francis Bacon, and the other by the Spanish seventeenth century artist Diego Velázquez.The work was first created in 2009, where it was projected on a monumental scale. Here, it continually dissolves and reforms to create a smaller-scale striated image that is reminiscent of digital rain. ",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Perceiving

All of which is elegantly encircled by a series of rotating rings that resemble Saturn’s rings in orbit. Spreading out to touch the edges of the screen, these dot and dash circles run in opposition to one another like helicopter blades, as they effectively animate around the central axis, giving the encircled merry-go-round an arresting appeal. And as the central narrative, when a precise number of rotations are complete, the outer rings disappear from view as proficiently and effectively as they originally appeared for the automated arm to draw the central hub back in on itself and balance is restored.","Part of the What If You Created Artificial Life And It Started Worshipping You series, The Feathered Serpent is a sophisticated take on an alternative life form.

The First Veil,27,Andrew Thomas Huang,https://www.seditionart.com/andrew-thomas-huang/the-first-veil,"For The First Veil, Andrew Thomas Huang divides up the cinematic screen into a triptych featuring the American dancer Bones the Machine and a smoking lantern, which has been central in digital edition, Interstice. The dancer moves to a choreographed routine wearing a futuristic black helmet. Long, penetrative nails are attached to his hands, symbols of power evocative of Chinese finger guards worn by royalty during the Qing dynasty. Masterfully comprised of upper-body limb isolations designed to cover the face, the dance performed by Bones suggests a divination ritual, conjuring the appearance of a red silk veil volitionally draping itself over the performer.  As the The First Veil completes its entrance, a piercing soundtrack crescendos to infiltrate the work, disrupting its ruminative quality with a wall of noise. The triptych concludes like a magic trick in which Bones vanishes behind the asphyxiating red silk skin that swallows his body whole.","For The First Veil, Andrew Thomas Huang divides up the cinematic screen into a triptych featuring the American dancer Bones the Machine and a smoking lantern, which has been central in digital edition, Interstice.

Created exclusively for Sedition, The Golden Boat is an excerpt from The Feast of Trimalchio (2009), the second part of The Liminal Space Trilogy concerning the modern world: hell, heaven, and purgatory. The work was inspired by Gaius Petronius Arbiter’s Satyricon, specifically the section - The Feast of Trimalchio.In large part due to Petronius's fantasy, Trimalchio's name has become synonymous with wealth, luxury, gluttony and unbridled pleasure. The Golden Boat depicts a vision of heaven in the form of a super-luxury hotel. The present-day Trimalchio has created the most exotic and luxurious hotel possible. The hotel guests, the ‘masters’, are from the land of the Golden Billion. The ‘masters’ wear white, which calls to mind the uniform of the righteous in the Garden of Eden, as well as traditional colonial dress or a summer fashion collection. Trimalchio's ‘servants’ are young, attractive representatives of all continents, who work in the vast hospitality industry as housekeeping staff, waiters, chefs, gardeners, security guards and masseurs. The ‘servants’ resemble the brightly coloured angels of a Garden of Eden, to which the ‘masters’ are only temporarily admitted. Both masters and servants become participants in an orgiastic gala reception - a dinner in the style of Roman saturnalia, when slaves dressed as patricians recline at tables, and their masters dressed in slaves' tunics, serve them.

Likened to an ‘en plein air’ landscape with a swell of deep water at its centre, Wenders’ image captures the tonality and idyllic atmosphere of this untempered landscape, as the river mirrors the sky, one above the other. All of the picture’s details appear to have been blurred into nuances of vegetation and uneven ground, either side of an undisturbed blanket of sea that runs like an artery through this unspecific landscape.

Even as these works allude to the artist-contrived triple perspectives of traditional Chinese landscape, the same indistinctness at the heart of their visual attraction also conceals from the viewer any accurate perception of their location, or their perception of depth, time, or even the nature of objects in the field of view. With some measure of irony, the artist recalls in this context, a quotation from the Chinese Classic of History, 772 – 476 BC: “The road is as truth not far from us.”","Jia began taking photos and videos for The Road Series during her first visit to Europe to attend Documenta 12 in 2007.

The Shrine, which is part of the What If You Created Artificial Life And it Started Worshipping You series, with its emotive soundtrack and idyllic natural rhythms appears to pay homage to the tranquility of an alternative dreamlike setting, in which the animated wildlife, the rippling turn of translucent water - unsettled by a rolling waterfall, the Japanese styled carpeted islands and protruding rocks - are all backdrop to a series of illuminated lanterns that twist and turn on their elevated axis, like alien figures looking to mate. Resembling something of John Wyndham’s mobile triffid plants, the more intriguing these elongated nuclei appear as they hover over the serene landscape, the more encompassing their appeal. Schockmel’s earth coloured palette and the depth with which he manages to extend the landscape out across the screen, makes for a remarkable piece of storytelling in which the constructed world becomes entirely plausible by the time it arrives at its closing sequence.","Elegantly esoteric in appearance, Schockmel’s animation emerges like a biblical landscape whereupon technology has convinced us of a vision of utopia.

The Siren,Not for sale,Laura Jean Healey,https://www.seditionart.com/laura-jean-healey/the-siren,"The Siren is a digital performance art film that uses the image and plays to the preconceived notions of this mythical temptress in order to explore the true nature of the audiences’ gaze, their innate desire to watch, and how the female form is represented within art and film.

Beautiful and haunting, she exists within the substantial nothingness of the screen as pure artifice and constructs her own reality. A reality in which she transcends the sexual clichés attached to the perception of the Siren and forces her audience to not only acknowledge her presence, power, and autonomy, but to question who is in control of the gaze: the watcher or the watched.The Siren was originally exhibited as a life size holographic film installation.

The words play out to form sentences which describe the realm of concentricity and the collision of simultaneous realities.

Time Of Flight,24,Mike Pelletier,https://www.seditionart.com/mike-pelletier/time-of-flight,"Mike Pelletier’s Time of Flight is a animated video that features a series of computer-generated 3D abstract forms that gently morph and mutate to a dreamy soundtrack. The forms are in fact derived from three-dimensional scans of humans, whose resultant data the artist has manipulated. These manipulations result in glitches which arise from a combination of structured data, imperfections in scanning algorithms and Pelletier’s interventions. At various stages of the work’s production data is reduced and simplified, or lost as noise; the artist explores this terrain of exchange and escape, connecting it to the human body. In doing this, he explores the complicated abstractions and simplifications which take place when a body is recorded and represented. Through a process of removing important information in some places and adding unnecessary information in others, Pelletier’s animation adapts and interferes with a process that passes on some data and rejects other data as noise; in adapting the process he challenges the concept of efficiency. The title of the work refers to a technique used by some cameras to capture 3D information. Time of Flight features a soundtrack by composer Arjen Jongeneel.","Mike Pelletier’s Time of Flight is a animated video that features a series of computer-generated 3D abstract forms that gently morph and mutate to a dreamy soundtrack.

Track Record is a video documentation of the 2005 work Terminus, an installation that relocated 14 socialist-era bus stops from the Polish town of Oswiecim (in German Auschwitz) into a gallery space in Berlin.Through one long tracking shot, the camera moves across a room capturing dislocated bus stations that stand empty and abandoned. In a steady movement, we are led past the stations in mimicry of a bus route, an eerie journey, empty of human life. The movie plays in silence, accompanied only by a subtle undefined background sound of the camera moving about the building. The technique applied to film the work is used to highlight the fact that what we see is a testimony to a fact - to 14 bus stations from Auschwitz - not an interpretation.Almond is fascinated by culturally specific points of arrival and departure and the means by which we reach these points, and how we understand them in time. Track Record is not only a record of the artist's own work - of an installation that no longer exists - but a record of a historical loss - that of Auschwitz.

Transfiguration,158,Universal Everything,https://www.seditionart.com/universal-everything/transfiguration,"Transfiguration, 2011, was created by Universal Everything together with Realise Studio for the reopening of the prestigious digital arts gallery La Gaite Lyrique, Paris. A bulky human figure walks at a brisk equalised speed at the centre of the screen and transforms in a cycle of progressively transient and surprising materials. We watch how flames grow into metal structures that transform into rock-like matter, out of which icy crystals spring. After numerous further transformations, the walking giant takes on liquid qualities, then becomes gas, and in turn transforms into a perfectly depicted fury figure out of innumerable strands of multi-coloured hair; and so on.All this time, the figure's journey across the black screen is accompanied by sound that correlates to what the viewer sees. Simultaneously, the audio is descriptive of the material of transformation itself. The figure finally dissolves into what appears to be stardust or simply light - underwritten by a high-pitched sparkly bell-like sound - and re-accumulates into flames that re-start the cycle.Universal Everything describes Transfiguration as: ""an anthropomorphic giant (that) endlessly evolves between primitive and advanced materials"". Both ""transfiguration"" and ""evolve"" are positive words that signify a development towards and into something: a progression. In this sense, Transfiguration can be seen as a work referencing the evolution of life and humanity itself, crossing from the simple elements over into a digital hyper-real age.","Transfiguration, 2011, was created by Universal Everything together with Realise Studio for the reopening of the prestigious digital arts gallery La Gaite Lyrique, Paris.

The footage is obliterated into a projection of colors that render leaves, branches, shadows and the sky into a flat plain. The style is typical of Alfred's work and reminds in particular of his 333 portrait series.However, Triangle Cloud uses an animation technique previously not deployed by the artist: the actual video work is made up of over 3000 drawings that are fused into a whole by rotoscoped animation. Rotoscoping is a technique whereby animators trace over footage frame by frame; in Triangle Cloud this method can be identified by innumerable colourful explosions of stars, stripes and what looks like pop brush-strokes or graffiti that flicker over the screen. The interruptions appear either behind or in front of the footage of the forest, sometimes many simultaneously. Alfred: ""I added the dynamics and energy that the peaceful scene seemed to hide.""Alfred's Triangle Cloud is hence romantic in subject matter - he depicts the solitude and stillness of a forest - and yet, the work is full of energy, is abstract, creative and of explosive character. By using an animation technique like rotoscoping in combination with his distinguishable graphic style, Alfred achieves something truly special with Triangle Cloud: the work becomes a combination of the best of what two worlds have to offer: the powerful impact of the two-dimensional starkly contrasted graphics, and the energizing enlivening qualities that digital animation can add to any two dimensional reality.","Brian Alfred's Triangle Cloud, 2012, is based on a video the artist took on location of a forest in upstate New York.

The digital edition is a continuation of the artist’s ongoing interest in working intuitively with computation and exploring the relationship between nature and machine through the creation of digital environments and worlds.In Turmoil a thick, vast, rolling digitally rendered landform appears to heave and mutate. The form moves powerfully and consistently, yet seems likely at any moment to combust, flatten and disperse to nothing.The accompanying soundtrack emphasises the fragile and unsettling equilibrium between order and chaos created by the visuals. Image and sound come together to produce a work which sits at the junction of different renderings of the real, referencing both the ocean wave and the algorithm.","Turmoil is an audiovisual artwork by Joëlle with soundtrack by electronic artist Killawatt.

Twisted Crystals,44,Doug Foster,https://www.seditionart.com/doug_foster/twisted-crystals,"Doug Foster’s video Twisted Crystals was inspired by the microscopic motion that takes place inside the pixels of liquid crystal displays, such as the displays used as television and computer screens. Footage of rotating crystalline materials - like glass, quartz and amethyst - was repeated, mirrored and expanded using an editing process that echoes the way that crystals grow in nature.The visual experience is enhanced by a one hertz base rhythm imposed on the imagery and accompanying soundtrack - one hertz being one of the most effective frequencies for calming human brain activity. The rhythm propagates many other audiovisual frequencies that interplay and slip out of phase with each other.The result is a constantly transforming mandala that mesmerises and calms simultaneously, leading to a beautiful and evolving cyclical experience.","Doug Foster’s video Twisted Crystals was inspired by the microscopic motion that takes place inside the pixels of liquid crystal displays, such as the displays used as television and computer screens.

Two Cars and A Woman Waiting,8,Wim Wenders,https://www.seditionart.com/wim_wenders/two_cars_and_a_woman_waiting,"Wim Wenders has directed many acclaimed films including a Road Movie trilogy. He also works with the medium of photography, and this work Two Cars and A Woman Waiting was originally part of the series Written in the West, exhibited at the Pompidou in 1986.A highly filmic quality underscores the photograph, with the framing seemingly recalling a film being projected onto a black screen. The stylised view captures two passing cars and a woman with a suitcase waiting on a corner. With a strong narrative element to the image, we long to know what happens next. For Wenders, the technical perfection of an image — its view, lines, colours — must balance perfectly with the emotion or tension of the scene it captures; otherwise the picture remains empty and one becomes merely a tourist snapping away at another view.

Typing,32,Shu Lea Cheang,https://www.seditionart.com/shu-lea-cheang/typing,"Typing (2014), taken from Cheang's piece, Baby Work (2012),  converts a web interface that appears as a patchwork of alternating circuit boards into a hypermedia work. Baby Work is a performative installation in which keyboards are stripped to the membrane, keys are detached and reinstalled by the viewing public. Typing is a recent capture of Baby Work's web simulation created exclusively for Sedition. In Typing multi-channel sound is randomly retrieved and composed as the 3D rendered keys appear and disappear one after another, until a shower of keys fills the screen entirely. All the while indecipherable sequences of electronic sound bytes and discordant jingles, chime in to create an increasingly dissonant soundtrack, which closes dramatically with a sharp note denoting the end of everything.","Typing (2014), taken from Cheang's piece, Baby Work (2012),  converts a web interface that appears as a patchwork of alternating circuit boards into a hypermedia work.

Uniclones 01,20,MARIEVIC,https://www.seditionart.com/marie-vic/uniclones-01,"The Uniclones collection is a series of nine video works derived from MarieVic’s two-channel video work, which was exhibited at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris in September 2017. The works present a binary view of a pastoral landscape in which livestock wander freely. Goats, sheep, camels, reindeers and yaks carry on as any animal would in a rural setting, except that they are draped in Uniqlo products. This gesture juxtaposes an agrarian life with the clothing derived from it, decontextualising mass produced clothing from its branded myth and repurposing it with wry, discordant effect. Uniclones comments on the relationship between Mongolian cashmere goats and Uniqlo cashmere sweaters, and more broadly, between nomadic life and fast fashion products.Uniclones also takes a close look at agrarian dynamics, at the role of the individual within the flock. This dynamic is somehow mirrored in the marketplace, in which companies like Uniqlo shepherd consumers toward products. As a global brand, Uniqlo has made accessible to the masses a luxury good that was once only available to the few. Their products are attractive, disposable and even ethical. The retailer provides its community of consumers an individuating product: it satisfies the hedonist desire of quality conscious consumers while neutralizing (via corporate social responsibility) the anxiety provoked by its own mechanisms of production, appeasing a sort of ethical dilemma within the herd. In this dynamic, the corporation has become the shepherd and the consumer the flock.Uniclones is somewhat subversive in its message, but playful in its tone. It is not clear that these are the exact animals from which this fabric comes, or that the production process is in any clear way unsettling. What is clear in the video project is that these animals are reasonably happy, and that they are draped in Western clothing, each one an individual, yet posturing collectively.","The Uniclones collection is a series of nine video works derived from MarieVic’s two-channel video work, which was exhibited at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris in September 2017.

Goats, sheep, camels, reindeers and yaks carry on as any animal would in a rural setting, except that they are draped in Uniqlo products. This gesture juxtaposes an agrarian life with the clothing derived from it, decontextualising mass produced clothing from its branded myth and repurposing it with wry, discordant effect.

This dynamic is somehow mirrored in the marketplace, in which companies like Uniqlo shepherd consumers toward products. As a global brand, Uniqlo has made accessible to the masses a luxury good that was once only available to the few. Their products are attractive, disposable and even ethical. The retailer provides its community of consumers an individuating product: it satisfies the hedonist desire of quality conscious consumers while neutralizing (via corporate social responsibility) the anxiety provoked by its own mechanisms of production, appeasing a sort of ethical dilemma within the herd.

Unless,12,Jill Greenberg,https://www.seditionart.com/jill_greenberg/unless,"Jill Greenberg’s photograph, Unless (2005) is part of her best known works in the End Times series. This is an image of her own daughter, Violet. The title is a reference to The Lorax by Dr. Suess concerning environmental destruction. The work exploits the raw emotion of toddlers unable to use their words to express themselves. The series features photographs of young children from the age of 2 to 4 years agitated as children due to their caregiver asking for a toy or sweet to be handed back to them. “As any parent knows, rarely does a toddler sobbing convey any real pain or mental anguish. At that age, crying it is one of the main methods of communication, and in this particular instance, a short tantrum provoked by gentle manipulation.” The face of the child is wet with tears and hair splayed and messy in the stark lighting, creates an arresting image that draws one in. Crying children are a common occurance; the photographs of them with dramatic lighting, creates luminous skin and a halo of light along with the light painting, which adds drama. It is something shocking and triggers our own recollection of intense emotions and feelings of helplessness.“The children’s worlds were not ending by having a lollipop asked for, but if only they had the capacity to understand what was happening to their world—to the environment—as a result of the backwards, conservative leadership in the White House in 2005, when the photographs were made, they would undoubtedly be distressed.” The work played with the irony that at the time where those in political power believed in ‘end times’ and wished for major disasters which would hasten the rapture. The esteemed photo critic and former head of the Photographer’s Gallery, Paul Wombell said that he had never found a series of images which linked to the future until these, since photography is typically a record of the past.While the work caused no controversy during a solo exhibition at Scope Art Fair in New York in April 2006, during its debut in Los Angeles, an anonymous male blogger asserted unfounded sexist claims against Greenberg in regards to the abuse of children. Greenberg’s techniques were harmless to the children where their parents gently coaxed the subjects into their distressed states of emotions.The series spawned legions of copycats in terms of the lighting retouching effect known as the ‘Jill Greenberg look’, which continues to be taught in art and photography schools around the world. The works have garnered awards and solo exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Adelaide, Australia, and group shows at Brown University, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art in Toronto, Boston University, and Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (curated by Paul Wombell).","Jill Greenberg’s photograph, Unless (2005) is part of her best known works in the End Times series.

The fur stands out along the neck of the animal against a pale blue backdrop which blends in with the shade of the fur.For Greenberg, polar bears represent “the canaries in the coal mine of global warming” as their habitat is being destroyed; they are the first victims of the climate crisis which we all face.

Vacation was constructed using both sculptural and pictorial elements modelled in a virtual 3D space. The object on display - reminiscent of an abstract hyperreal vacation home - transforms in relation to the rectangle of the work’s frame, the surrounding screen, much like a painting.

Vanishing Point,48,Marion Tampon-Lajarriette,https://www.seditionart.com/marion-tampon-lajarriette/vanishing-point,"Marion Tampon-Lajarriette’s silent film Vanishing Point, 2013, captures an image of a ‘jardin à la française’ with a water feature - possibly a canal. A tracking shot leads the viewer into the perspective and materiality of the image until its final fade into darkness - with the camera sweeping over the earth’s surface in an elongated movement that increasingly becomes obfuscated. This motion of the camera plays with the limits of the virtual eye traveling ‘inside’ a 2D original image constructed out of geometry and regularity. Half way through the film, the sequence plays backward and therewith creates an infinite loop between the view of the ‘jardin à la française’ and nothingness - a black screen.Vanishing Point is linked with Tampon-Lajarriette’s work Paramnesia, which explores baroque castle-sites that served as setting to the film “Last Year at Marienbad” (Alain Resnais, 1961) - and is a typical example of Tampon-Lajarriette’s work: to reference time and the creation of memory through proxy. Just like “Last Year at Marienbad”, Vanishing Point raises the question what makes us experience time as we do, and why we remember it the way we do. Tampon-Lajarriette deploys a single simple camera move within one setting in order to explore the idea that it is difficult to arrange linear time as we remember it, and not to let our memory of something pre-determine our experience of time itself. In particular, the theory of “Duration” by French philosopher Henri Bergson (b.1927) comes to mind. Bergson distinguished between the concept of time (as per a clock) and the experience of time (real time). He was of the opinion that real time is experienced as duration and apprehended by intuition, with time in constant flux, where moments of past and presence have equal reality. Vanishing Point seems to suggest the same theory, triggering intuitive reactions by obliterating the image and recreating it in a never-ending loop,  where memory and reality stand equally side by side.Marion Tampon-Lajarriette lives and works in Paris, France, and Geneva, Switzerland.","Marion Tampon-Lajarriette’s silent film Vanishing Point, 2013, captures an image of a ‘jardin à la française’ with a water feature - possibly a canal.

At times they envelop the frame, or disappear from view before straight edges momentarily emerge. The works feature a subtle piano soundtrack with varying lengths of pauses between notes that is inspired by Kepler’s planetary scale, which assigns a melody to each of the five planets known to science at the time, according to their speed of rotation and orbit.Tampon-Lajarriette follows this historical exploration of the connections between planetary orbits, musical scales, and geometric forms, using here the materiality and illusions of the digital image.

WaterFell,35,Terry Flaxton and Emily Burridge,https://www.seditionart.com/terry-flaxton-and-emily-burridge/waterfell,"WaterFell, by Terry Flaxton and Emily Burridge, is an evocation of the substance and importance of water and its influence on human and other forms of life. Today we understand that water is beginning to be discovered on many planets and asteroids in the solar system – and by extension we know that like light, water is universe-wide. For the scientist water can become, apart from everything else, fuel to travel through space; for the person travelling, it is also a life-sustaining element. It has a profound and extraordinary behaviour as it assumes many states at different temperatures - and so being ourselves 98 percent water, we share those unusual and distinctive properties in our bodies and minds.WaterFell seeks to recognise this singular material in a manner that expresses its distinctive properties. Its inception came when Burridge, whose work combines sound composition and performance, and Flaxton, whose work centres around video, photography and sound composition, each independently produced work inspired by the beauty of water sonically and visually, before discovering the parallels between each other’s work. They then swapped their images and sounds, inspiring each other and slowly the composition evolved organically in their individual production studios, influenced by the particular form of digital technology used by each artist. Their joint working practice commenced with Sanctus (also available on Sedition) an evocation to the importance of trees in our lives. They now plan to continue working on a series of works exploring fundamental elements that we share common properties with.","WaterFell, by Terry Flaxton and Emily Burridge, is an evocation of the substance and importance of water and its influence on human and other forms of life.

For the scientist water can become, apart from everything else, fuel to travel through space; for the person travelling, it is also a life-sustaining element. It has a profound and extraordinary behaviour as it assumes many states at different temperatures - and so being ourselves 98 percent water, we share those unusual and distinctive properties in our bodies and minds.WaterFell seeks to recognise this singular material in a manner that expresses its distinctive properties. Its inception came when Burridge, whose work combines sound composition and performance, and Flaxton, whose work centres around video, photography and sound composition, each independently produced work inspired by the beauty of water sonically and visually, before discovering the parallels between each other’s work. They then swapped their images and sounds, inspiring each other and slowly the composition evolved organically in their individual production studios, influenced by the particular form of digital technology used by each artist. Their joint working practice commenced with Sanctus (also available on Sedition) an evocation to the importance of trees in our lives. They now plan to continue working on a series of works exploring fundamental elements that we share common properties with.",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Perceiving

"Westhay, Somerset",22,Terry Flaxton,https://www.seditionart.com/terry-flaxton/westhay-somerset,"Terry Flaxton’s artwork in response to Westhay nature reserve is linked to that made in King’s Canyon, 10,000 miles away. At the nature reserve, his deep sense of place led him to create a complex mosaic response. Flaxton moved to Somerset 25 years ago to escape ‘the linear tendencies of the art world’; today the area is more popular, more regulated, and more political than when he first arrived; ‘you now have to look beneath the surface to find what’s real’. Despite modernisation, the historic character of Somerset still carries force, as does the burl of the language of Somerset people who said things like: “Do thee tell I what thou b’ainst be dwan?” (what are you’re doing?)With this piece and its partner in King’s Canyon, Flaxton works with proximity and distance, finding familiarity in far countries or the landscape close by. The interplay between familiarity and distance connects two far-off places and emphasises the particular atmospherics and frisson involved in representing place.

What Remains In The Air,10,Eva Papamargariti,https://www.seditionart.com/eva-papamargariti/what-remains-in-the-air,"Prosomiosis is the Greek word for simulation; the term refers to the simulation of reality and its phenomena. The works in Eva Papamargariti’s Prosomiosis collection are comprised of 3D rendered scenes. In creating and compiling these scenes, Papamargariti attempts to create a fictitious digital environment inspired by geometries and patterns that can be found in the natural world. These natural geometries and forms are re-constructed and re-presented as fragments of a virtual ecosystem that could be extracted from the world of dreams and imagination. Paradox runs through the work; it can be found in the digital representation of nature, and in the tension between the wildly unfurling forms and the decisions made to arrange, order and shape them.In What Remains In The Air the movement of diverse 3D generated forms has been frozen into a still image. The immobile floating forms evoke leaves and dappled light without ever resolving into a legible landscape or narrative. The intangible materiality of the rendered objects and textures that make up the Prosomiosis project builds an abstract syntax of organic digital elements that could exist on the threshold of actuality and fiction and provoke thoughts on the constantly changing synthesis of fiction and material reality.","Prosomiosis is the Greek word for simulation; the term refers to the simulation of reality and its phenomena.

Each artwork begins with a series of photographs, something random, something composed, something noticed, a moment captured in the cycle. After a lengthy selection process the most interesting photographs are separated and grouped together ready for the next stage . Using photo editing software all of the selected images are filtered with paint effects. They are then blended and fused back with the originals. An evolutionary process of applying effects, blending and fusing continues until I feel I have the right images for the final art.

1. REPEATING MYSELF,8,Lynnly Benson,https://www.seditionart.com/lynnly-benson/1-repeating-myself-2,"1. Repeating Myself is an audiovisual art-piece that exemplifies Queer Becoming as an inevitable state of futurity through disidentification and dismantled repetition. Within a society that is built on hegemonic pretence, queerness is always only approaching the present and never actually getting anywhere. As a feminine queer person, the artist must deliberately differentiate themselves from an assumed heteronormative default to be visible as queer. However this is a performance that is invalid without an audience - and there is no way to encounter all of society in a singular timeframe to permanently solidify this existence. Performativity and disidentification cannot be applied in a clean sweep across a society, it can only be applied in the present, and must be repeated to some extent in every present after that. This audiovisual piece shows a Utopian Becoming of self that Unbecomes from a relatable visual of facial humanness into a point of utopia. By repeating this sequence of Utopian Becoming in uneven pieces, 1. Repeating Myself visually depicts the non-linear temporality of queer existence. An audio recording of white noise is used within the piece and is slowly distorted as the sequence moves forward to mimic the need to Unbecome from what is actually already inherently there to enforce reaching somewhere.","1.

A Sense of Attraction 1,8,Leonardo Solaas,https://www.seditionart.com/leonardo-solaas/a-sense-of-attraction-1,"A Sense of Attraction is a series of generative images about the possibility of drawing feelings and emotions. The starting point is photos of flowers, which provide the organic shapes and the strong colors. However, those naturalistic images are transformed into semi-abstract designs through an algorithmic process that sets in motion a large number of autonomous computational agents. The input photo serves as a sort of virtual terrain to guide the movement of these “drawing particles”. The accumulation of their trajectories as they are traced to the screen gradually builds the resulting image.Therefore, this is also a visualization of swarm behavior, or a picture of a multitude. The photos of flowers become something else by means of the mathematical interpretation of color values as force vectors. In each particle the tension between control and randomness, or between environment influence and self-determination, results in a complex path that is perhaps the simplest possible seed of a feeling in the heart of a computer.The generative program was coded by the author using the Processing language.","A Sense of Attraction is a series of generative images about the possibility of drawing feelings and emotions.

The sequence is: .jpg > .rgb > .jpf > .iff > .aic > .raw > .tiff > .jpgThe aim of this project is to put together a scientific research method like staining and a glitch art technic like databending as both have the goal of revealing the beauty of invisible universes to human eyes.This work is a collaboration with Valeria Panzetta, Junior Postdoc.",Introverted,Intuitive,Thinking,Perceiving

This first-order inquiry cannot proceed without acknowledgment of claims made by media and cultural theorists, art theorists and art audiences, concerning the way digital image- and sound-making technologies are fundamentally changing our understanding of art, representation, and perceptual experience. These claims suggest that the “digital condition” induces a loss of trust in the image, a new way of experiencing the world as indeterminate and fragmentary, and a breakdown of traditional boundaries between artist and audience, artwork and artistic process. Testing these claims requires a formal understanding of the distinction between analog and digital systems and the implications of that distinction for aesthetic appreciation. The philosophy of digital art proceeds from a carefully articulated general account of digital representation to an investigation of the precise ways in which different kinds of digital art are digital. This leads to a further investigation into the ways an artwork’s digital status bears on its appropriate appreciation. By conducting a systematic analysis of the digital as an artistically significant category, the philosophy of digital art seeks to ground burgeoning interdisciplinary and popular interest in the so-called “digital revolution”.","First and foremost, the philosophy of digital art is the study of the nature and appreciative grounds of all those kinds of art whose production and presentation crucially involves computer processing.

Asanoha is a Japanese geometric pattern, a hexagonal abstraction of the ‘Asa’ plant’s leaves.

Ben McDonnell’s At The Still Point appears to visualise this duality by conceiving of a work that infinitely repeats itself whilst also remaining still. McDonnell’s reconstructed image of a rolling seascape is an exploration of the stillness of an image, the moment of indecision and the discourse between the potential and the happening. Within this framework of perpetual self-reflection the seascape becomes an unresolvable dialogue between land and sea, movement and lack of movement. The artist explains: “...through this work I am attempting to examine the quality of a ‘silenced’ relationship, as a campaign for silence. And just as there is a time for action, there is an equally a moment for prolonged silence.” At The Still Point is a video piece derived from a sculptural installation titled Dialogue/Boundary (2016).","In T.S.

The tutu is a wearable electronic instrument which is also equipped with a digital sampler, contact microphone, movement sensor, MP3 player, and radio receiver which allows the dancers to work dynamically with the sounds, surfaces, and topographies of the space around them. The high-pitched synthesised noise of the PEEPERS solo piece fluctuates with the dancer's movement. Her movements are erratic yet precise as she experiments with both sound and gesture.Audio Ballerinas was originally created in 1989 as a solar-powered tutu for the Festivals Les Arts au Soleil in Lille/ Aeronef. Since then, Maubrey has presented the work in numerous festivals internationally and has created a variety of site-specific solo and group choreographies.

Blue Sun,8,Nathalia Rus,https://www.seditionart.com/nathalia-rus/blue-sun,"In memory of a dear friend. « Blue Sun » aims to make us think about the immense, small and vast things in our world and beyond, those things which cannot be seen with human eyes. The Sun is usually represented by warm, vivid tones and vibrantly joyful atmospheres, by contrast to the mysterious, cold, dark and nostalgic Moon. Yet, in reality, the inner core of the flame is blue. The range is between 2,600 and 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is the most oxygen-rich type of flame. The temperature range for Red is  525 °C (980 °F). Our traditional associations for color and temperature tell us that red is hot, and blue is cold. How strange is it to think of blue as a hot color? As such, we cannot make assumptions on how someone truly feels based on how one looks or behaves. We try to simplify things to break them down into small parts. As a software engineer, indeed, I understand this has made us solve the seemingly impossible. But when navigating the world of Ideas, I believe, no matter how hard you try, there is no way of simplifying things - and there is no point in simplifying things. People are multi-dimensional, contradictory on the surface, and no one is able to understand oneself, nor other selves. Compassion and empathy are what makes us be and feel connected with each others, beyond any rational understanding. “I did not know how to reach him, how to catch up with him... The land of tears is so mysterious.” ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince ","In memory of a dear friend. « Blue Sun » aims to make us think about the immense, small and vast things in our world and beyond, those things which cannot be seen with human eyes. The Sun is usually represented by warm, vivid tones and vibrantly joyful atmospheres, by contrast to the mysterious, cold, dark and nostalgic Moon. Yet, in reality, the inner core of the flame is blue. The range is between 2,600 and 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, it is the most oxygen-rich type of flame. The temperature range for Red is  525 °C (980 °F). Our traditional associations for color and temperature tell us that red is hot, and blue is cold. How strange is it to think of blue as a hot color? As such, we cannot make assumptions on how someone truly feels based on how one looks or behaves. We try to simplify things to break them down into small parts. As a software engineer, indeed, I understand this has made us solve the seemingly impossible. But when navigating the world of Ideas, I believe, no matter how hard you try, there is no way of simplifying things - and there is no point in simplifying things. People are multi-dimensional, contradictory on the surface, and no one is able to understand oneself, nor other selves. Compassion and empathy are what makes us be and feel connected with each others, beyond any rational understanding. “I did not know how to reach him, how to catch up with him... The land of tears is so mysterious.” ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince ",Introverted,Intuitive,Feeling,Judging

Or is it more because it first grants truth as equivalence and certitude, because there can be no presence and presenting outside of the realm of the opening?Is conspiracy in other words Alethea?

The literal meaning of the word ἀ–λήθεια is ""the state of not being hidden; the state of being evident."" It also means factuality or reality.Heidegger gave an etymological analysis of aletheia and drew out an understanding of the term as 'unconcealedness'. Thus, aletheia is distinct from conceptions of truth understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs, or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole. Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an ontological ""world"" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.","Video art ""conspiracy"".

"Composition: White Square, White Circle",16,Ryo Ikeshiro,https://www.seditionart.com/ryo_ikeshiro/composition_white_square_white_circle,"Composition: White Square, White Circle is a mixed-media work. It is based on the artist’s live audiovisualisation performance piece Construction in Kneading, but the two works are distinct in character. CWSWC was created exclusively for s[edition].For Composition: White Square, White Circle, one and the same process in the digital medium generates both sound and moving image, and movements and patterns that are seen are also heard - and vice versa. Simple abstract designs are used, based on folding into a square and stretching into a circle; much like kneading dough. These shapes are moved to and fro, and gently transformed into complex structures, and back again. Despite being generated by cold, geometric forms, the wave-like motion gives the work an organic quality, suggesting the cyclical character of nature.The title is a homage to the Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich.","Composition: White Square, White Circle is a mixed-media work.

This invasion mimics the zooming in on our phones or tablets into images that are not ours, yet we do it anyway, and cannot look away.

Particles are animated visualizing what happens when an electron splits into anti-electrons during a cascade event (an electromagnetic particle shower).In quantum mechanical theory, a particle shower is a predictable event and suggests that an electron all by itself may have infinite charge and infinite mass, but once split, its charge and mass becomes finite.

"Joan of Arc, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA",8,Tracy Steen,https://www.seditionart.com/tracy-steen/joan-of-arc-philadelphia-museum-of-art-philadelphia-pa,"Napoleon III commissioned this statue of Joan of Arc to help re-establish French confidence following defeats by the Prussian army in 1870. During the medieval clash for control of France known as the Hundred Years’ War, Joan of Arc was a hero to the forces of Charles VII of Valois. Inspired by saints, she rose from humble circumstances to lead an army against the other claimant to the French throne, Henry VI of England. Joan of Arc was martyred in 1431, but her victory at Orléans in 1429 had already turned the tide of the war in favor of the Valois dynasty.This monument is an example of how public art can be successfully relocated and renovated. Emmanuel Fremmier created the statue in 1874, and in 1890 the Fairmount Park Art Association bought it ungilded. It was first placed at the east end of the Girard Avenue Bridge, but this location was not a success. In 1959, the statue was gilded and moved to its current location, across from the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Kelly Drive, where it has been an inspiration. It was removed to repair a crack in 2009, re-gilded, and returned in 2010.This statue is the original. Copies of a subsequent version, also gilded, exist in New Orleans, LA; Portland, OR; and on the Place des Pyramides in central Paris outside the Louvre. Additional ungilded copies of the subsequent version exist in Nancy, France, and Melbourne, Australia. In the subsequent version, Fremmier increased Joan of Arc’s size in comparison to the horse she rides.","Napoleon III commissioned this statue of Joan of Arc to help re-establish French confidence following defeats by the Prussian army in 1870.

Nāga,40,Aaron Higgins,https://www.seditionart.com/aaron-higgins/naga,"Traditions about nāgas are very common in all the Buddhist countries of Asia. Nāga, is the Sanskrit word for a spirit being that takes the form of a very great snake. In Tibet, the nāga can take the form of a dragon serpent living in lakes or underground streams as a sort of deity that can affect weather patterns and conjure thunderstorms.In 2010, I traveled to China and Tibet and brought along a book of Buddhist philosophies and teachings that used the nāga, or dragon, as a metaphor for fear. It went on to suggest that we as individuals must meet our fear, we must meet our dragon and find the edges of our self and grow as conscious beings. This was an attractive analogy to me, I saw a truth or value in it that was familiar.It's easy correlating this concept to how I experience the creative process. I am aware of the fear that lurks on a blank sheet of paper, a blank canvas, digital or otherwise. The creative process can cause anxiety at times, as do change and life experiences. It takes nerve to leap into what is unknown or unfamiliar, to make that first mark and meet your dragon.","Traditions about nāgas are very common in all the Buddhist countries of Asia.

Over time patterns emerged; hastily written notes appeared insightful in new ways, while en masse the anecdotes take on a character both meticulous and ephemeral. Conceiving of a permanent state of heightened romance, Aishman sees as much love in the elementary jottings of a shopping list in of a more considered sonnet; as each message becomes amplified evidence of a family’s emotional attachment to one another.

New Kind of Cinema was programmed in Mathematica and inspired by the usage of cellular automata after training with Stephen Wolfram in Pisa during the summer of 2009. Computer animations are created by providing the program with images drawn from popular culture (e.g. Michael Jackson, the tower of Pisa, a Chess set), after which, the computer program automatically creates a unique video such that a single black cell mutates into each target image. This process of emergence illustrates the manner in which complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.This project streamlines the creation of a seamless animation based upon the input of an image and a specified search size that is to be explored. Fourier and Compression methods are used as a metric in order to select the rule which generates a form that is most similar to a target image's Fourier transform and compression size. After selecting an optimized rule, a complete animation is generated, which begins with a single black cell and ends with the originally selected image.","Ilfeld's New Kind of Cinema work was showcased at TEDxLondon in 2011, included in the Apparatjik iPhone magazine and archived in Rhizome's ArtBase.

In her work, Georges explores the spaces in-between real and the virtual to create a new poetic language. Using 3D modelling techniques, the artist created a photorealistic image of two faces; in this way the virtual becomes a lifelike model.

Ouroboros (2018),24,Stuart Sandford,https://www.seditionart.com/stuart_sandford/ouroboros-2018,"A digital version of a new large-scale statue (work in progress) created using a combination of state-of-the-art 3D scanning technologies and traditional casting methods. Further small-scale versions exist in bronze, stainless steel, and Carrara marble. The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. The name originates from within Greek language; (oura) meaning ""tail"" and (boros) meaning ""eating"", thus ""he who eats the tail"". The Ouroboros represents the perpetual cyclic renewal of life and infinity, the concept of eternity and the eternal return, and represents the cycle of life, death and rebirth, leading to immortality, as in the Phoenix. The current mathematical symbol for infinity - may be derived from a variant on the classic Ouroboros with the snake looped once before eating its own tail.","A digital version of a new large-scale statue (work in progress) created using a combination of state-of-the-art 3D scanning technologies and traditional casting methods.

Prelude to Soho Dreaming,20,Victoria Rio,https://www.seditionart.com/victoria-rio/prelude-to-soho-dreaming,"Prelude to Soho Dreaming is the second of a series of vertical split-screen videos exploring ephemeral visions, emotions and perspectives experienced by individuals in urban environments, whether they choose to dive into the noise or separate themselves. An individual is walking nonchalantly through a faceless crowd, refusing to acknowledge the presence of others or respect their personal space. His mind is focused on conflicting emotions of freedom, disinterest and impatience, and his vision is blurred. The slight unbalance between the upper and lower fields framing the walk reflects his inner vulnerability and the continuous feeling that the ground is slowly slipping away.","Prelude to Soho Dreaming is the second of a series of vertical split-screen videos exploring ephemeral visions, emotions and perspectives experienced by individuals in urban environments, whether they choose to dive into the noise or separate themselves.

"Pure Movement 3, Environment 1.2",17,Ulla Nolden,https://www.seditionart.com/ulla-nolden/pure-movement-3-environment-1-2,"Ulla Nolden’s Pure Movement series articulates her perception of the beauty of movement itself, separate from the entities which produce it. Pure Movement 3 is the result of her fascination with the varied yet balanced movement of insect swarms. She experiences the visual perception of movement as accumulative. Over time, Nolden layers observations of similar movements to form one complete percept. As part of this process, the rules governing the movement are clarified, formalised and translated into computational instructions. Nolden’s computational representation of swarm behaviour draws on the work of Craig W. Reynolds and Daniel Shiffman. Although based on very simple behavioural rules, the resulting group movement becomes very complex.Nolden states: “Every member in a swarm is autonomous, there is no leader. The movement is created by each entity following a set of behavioural rules: align with the movements of your neighbours, move toward the average of your neighbours’ positions, keep at a distance from your neighbours, move towards a specified point in space, wander aimlessly.” And further on her process: “I visualise the abstract algorithm using the aesthetic language I developed in my photographic work. I situate the algorithm in different environments. For this work I place the movement into the digital frame of an image taken from the EVERYDAY project, a daily photographic record of my visual perception.”","Ulla Nolden’s Pure Movement series articulates her perception of the beauty of movement itself, separate from the entities which produce it. Pure Movement 3 is the result of her fascination with the varied yet balanced movement of insect swarms. She experiences the visual perception of movement as accumulative. Over time, Nolden layers observations of similar movements to form one complete percept.

Producing a series of scenes that sit on top of and intertwine with other, Overlap’s intervention makes for a mesmerising montage, which explores the invincibility and invisibleness of both natural world and produced image. As one after another the images are replaced by a new formation there develops an increasing sense of the impossibility of returning to the image that was there before.","In Overlap's Returning, the vast openness of the American wilderness is disrupted in the manner of a transmission, subject to outside interference.

Even the best Xuan paper will turn yellow after years, oxidation and mildew can damage a heirloom easily. Sometimes this ancient feeling can put a price tag on the object because of the lie of its value as an antique, however the fact is that the object decays, and then keeps rotten.Traditional Chinese painters didn’t dig into the fact that how an object is formed, rather, they cared about how the canvas is formed by objects - by the dots, lines and shapes (点, 线, 面) extracting from objects, and tried to control the canvas as a whole through real and sham (虚和实) operations of brush. However, the lack of understanding of a single object becomes a big disadvantage of the nation. By understanding above facts against the traditional form of Chinese art, I admired the execution behind this form of art. To use ink and brush to create a feeling, without errors, requires extreme concentration and determination. Different from other forms of art, the medium of Chinese ink painting is fragile, there is no room for revision. Once there are some careless drops, or a cup of tea spilled on the paper by a cat, there is no savior and the work has to be destroyed.This practice focuses on “virtual and real”, paying tributes to a great Chinese painter Qi Baishi, who executed the philosophy of balance so right with ink and brush.

Whenever the video is played, the resonance is activated through the streaming field.

At this early age, a strong affection was born for the sandy soil, long-leaf pines, and hot, salty summer breezes of coastal Alabama. Between the age of seven and twelve he moved with his family to Shreveport, LA and Richmond, VA, but then returned home to south Alabama and has never left.After spending 5 years working his way through college, he graduated from the University of South Alabama in 1977 with a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree with concentrations in studio painting and printmaking. During that time he won a scholarship from the Mobile Art Patrons League. After working months on his Pre-Thesis and Senior Thesis show, while being advised by Dr. James Kennedy, David McCann and Lee Hoffman, he was awarded an unanimous “A” by the Thesis Committee. Since college, Simmons has worked in many mediums including painting, colored-pencil, mixed-media, cast-paper, papermaking, book-binding, sculpture, and even designing and building furniture. For many he is best known for his masterful serigraphs with as many as 140 colors; one of only a few to use the “relief print transfer” method in his work. He is also known for his cast-paper reliefs developed by the artist and called “Mixoglyphs” to represent this unique new medium.","Born in 1952, the fourth child of a minister, David L.

It was commissioned by Louis-Philippe d’Orléans, “King of the French.” The original Sitting Lion is in Paris. Famed art collector William T. Walters donated this copy to the City of Baltimore in 1885. The monument is a tribute to Louis-Philippe’s liberal revolution that overthrew the Bourbon monarchy. His reformist, constitutional July Monarchy came to power during a three-day revolution from July 27 to July 20, 1830. The lion references Leo, the sign of the zodiac that governs late July. The July Monarchy was itself overthrown in 1848 when a revolution ushered in the more liberal but short-lived Second Republic. Sitting Lion is an example of a monument that has thrived over time. Located in a park outside the Walters family home in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore, the monument has not been moved since it was unveiled in 1885.

The piece extracts aesthetic elements from online resources dealing with anxiety and self help. The GIF format compiles still images into a moving sequence which repeats in an infinite loop. This style of reformatting reframes self help and anxiety in relation to the influence of digital media.Diagnosing the Cure takes self-diagnosis videos and therapeutic home practices sourced online as its starting point.

Stroop BLUE IN Red Series 3 Maclean,20,Iain Maclean,https://www.seditionart.com/iain-maclean/stroop-blue-in-red-series-3-maclean,"This series of paintings by Iain Maclean explores the Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect was named after American psychologist John Stroop and is now an important part of Neuroscience. It demonstrates that words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the colour. The interference between what the words say and the actual colour of the words your brain identifies causes the brain's reaction time to slow down. This was originally a painting that has been digitally modified in 2019. The original hasn't been exhibited.There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:1. Speed of Processing Theory: the interference occurs because words are read faster than colours are named.2.  Selective Attention Theory: the interference occurs because naming colours requires more attention than reading words.It takes longer to process information that requires both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Verbal skills use the left hemisphere and non-verbal skills use the right hemisphere. Colour distinction uses the non-verbal hemisphere, which is also in the left hemisphereSimilar tests are used clinically to assess brain damage, dementia and the effects of altitude on Everest climbers.

"Stroop Grey,black,brown Series 3",20,Iain Maclean,https://www.seditionart.com/iain-maclean/stroop-grey-black-brown-series-3,"This series of paintings by Iain Maclean explores the Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect was named after American psychologist John Stroop and is now an important part of Neuroscience. It demonstrates that words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the colour. The interference between what the words say and the actual colour of the words your brain identifies causes the brain's reaction time to slow down. There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:1. Speed of Processing Theory: the interference occurs because words are read faster than colours are named.2.  Selective Attention Theory: the interference occurs because naming colours requires more attention than reading words.It takes longer to process information that requires both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Verbal skills use the left hemisphere and non-verbal skills use the right hemisphere. Colour distinction uses the non-verbal hemisphere, which is also in the left hemisphereSimilar tests are used clinically to assess brain damage, dementia and the effects of altitude on Everest climbers.

Switcher Feedback 2v3 - Tod Mesirow visuals Jim Lang music,20,Tod Mesirow,https://www.seditionart.com/tod-mesirow/switcher-feedback-2v3-tod-mesirow-visuals-jim-lang-music,"In 1990 I was producing a weekly television series about fine art titled Appreciating Art, which was hosted by Conrad Janis, son of Sidney Janis, the New York gallerist who represented artist like Mondrian, Josef Albers, de Kooning and Jackson Pollack.  Having Conrad approve the writing about art I did for the series was comforting.  One day while assembling an episode in the control room I noticed distortions on one of the monitors.  “What’s causing that?” I asked the technician.  “It’s just distortion caused by a feedback loop in the switcher.”  I became mesmerized as I manipulated the shapes and patterns of the distortion, the colors, and the movement.  I recorded my manipulations, and when the show ended put the tapes on a shelf in the basement.  Recently I pulled them out, and assembled several versions of Switcher Feedback.

Mimicking the classic analogue video feedback process, this software simulation creates unlimited complexity from an economy of means. A simple square shape is passed around a loop of connected renderers (virtual screens). Transformations of the square are applied to its conveyance resulting in a multitude of feedback forms, geometric tessellations and branching structures that reconfigure over time.

Rogala now animates this kind of image so that we witness a process of ever-changing transfiguration in which the familiar lines, shape, and color of an everyday apple become changed and recombined. Without erasing the source image, the artist encourages the viewer to notice and appreciate its component elements.   Inside becomes outside, center becomes periphery, wide becomes narrow, small becomes large.  Stillness transforms into motion. This defamiliarizing of an everyday object becomes at once a paradoxical, oxymoronic form of what is both guided, accelerated contemplation and contemplative, decelerated animation.

The Cosmos Inside Out,8,Artmosphere,https://www.seditionart.com/artmosphere/the-cosmos-inside-out,"This artwork was created in 2017. The artist is fascinated about the mysterious icons of Tibetan Buddhism, and created this animated piece of work using public collections from the Met. It all started with sun (three-legged bird) and moon (rabbit) rotating around the Mount Meru, the symbol for Indo-Himalayan cosmic diagram. The landscape vignettes at the cardinal directions represent the four continents of Indian mythology but follow the artistic conventions of Chinese-style “blue-and-green” landscapes. Then other three levels of illustration turn up gradually following the sun/moon movements. One shows Hevajra and his consort Nairatmya dance at the intersection of four vajra gateways. Hevajra’s name is composed of “he,” compassion, representing the male aspect, and “Vajra,” wisdom, the female aspect, which together offer the path beyond the illusory world. Others show Vajrabhairava, and six-armed goddess (devi), Jnanadakini. It is said that the Mount Meru is incredibly enormous, as high as 1 million KM, while it is also tiny, contained in one seed. It seems to the artist that one is outside the Mount Meru, looking at day and night alternating, while the Mount Meru is actually inside one’s mind, the symbols of wisdom, mercy and strength reflected in one’s soul. As Whitman wrote in the poem, I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself, quoted in the accompanying song, courtesy of Blue Tears Band, music by Shaolu Li.

Using DSLR camera and video editing program Adobe Premiere and for the VFX used Adobe After Effects. The sound was designed by Boris Marinin inspired from black metal music genre.Video art statement:The Eridanus Supervoid is a large supervoid (an area of the universe devoid of galaxies) discovered as of 2007. At a diameter of about one billion light years it is the second largest known void, superseded only by the Giant Void in Canes Venatici. It was discovered by linking a ""cold spot"" in the cosmic microwave background to an absence of radio galaxies in data of the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array Sky Survey. In late 2007, argued that the Cold Spot could be due to a cosmic texture, a remnant of a phase transition in the early Universe. A controversial claim by Laura Mersini-Houghton is that it could be the imprint of another universe beyond our own, caused by quantum entanglement between universes before they were separated by cosmic inflation. Laura Mersini-Houghton said, ""Standard cosmology cannot explain such a giant cosmic hole"" and made the remarkable hypothesis that the WMAP cold spot is ""… the unmistakable imprint of another universe beyond the edge of our own."" If true, this provides the first empirical evidence for a parallel universe. It would also support string theory. The team claims that there are testable consequences for its theory.","This new video art was made in 2018 and exclusively offered on Sedition.

Additional credits for robotic installation, electrical engineer; Aras Vaichas, programmer; Jeremy Apthorp, lighting; Mirabelle Wouters, costume; Sally Jackson. As the title suggests, the work is a masquerade ball for robots. Partly inspired by E.T.A Hoffman’s The Sandman (1817). In which a young man falls in love with a feminine automaton, Olympia, who dances with him at a ball. The Sandman is a key-feature in Sigmund Freud’s essay The Uncanny (1919). Since Freud’s association between the uncanny and the automaton, the uncanny has continued to be a key term in robotics. Namely Professor Mori’s Uncanny Valley (1970). The hypothesis warned artists not to design robots too human-like, otherwise the robot would repel the human viewer and thus fall into the Uncanny Valley, a state of fear and disbelief. In this work Marynowsky seeks to test if an unnerving effect could still be reached if the robots are designed as abstracted human-like forms. Automated lighting, including moments of darkness and an eerie soundscape enhances the slightly menacing atmosphere. The robotic theatre experience creates ""a space where (free of superstition and paranoia) we do not see the reanimated corpses of ourselves but rather other autonomous beings, improvising"", Bec Dean.","The Hosts: A Masquerade Of Improvising Automatons, 2010, Beyond Mediations, Mediations Biennale, The 2nd International biennale of contemporary art, Poznan, Poland.

THE MONEY COMPLEX,30,Emilio Vavarella,https://www.seditionart.com/emilio-vavarella/the-money-complex," This artwork explores the correlation between power and money in a virtual landscape. I created a complex system, which aims to highlight the hidden structures of power which create value (and money) through the use of pictures and symbols. How many works of art – from painting to architecture – are used to link money to the system of the value of art? How many countries have the need to formulate their national identity through the appropriation of artistic images? And, what’s the role of art in the face of all this? In creating this work, I focused on irrational and random connections, using economic analyses along with personal interpretations. The resulting image of the world overlaps intricate systems of connections in order to create new ideas through free association. Every time this work is presented its system of connections will be different, based on new analyses and new interpretations. This is the first version, created for the 2013 GLITCH festival – Run computer, Run, Economics + The Immaterial, curated by Nora O Murchú at RUA RED, Dublin, Ireland."," This artwork explores the correlation between power and money in a virtual landscape.

This new work in Claire Reika Wright's River of Memories series is  a painter’s reflection on memory loss. If we lose our sense of time, place and memory we become detached from ourselves, disorientated and frightened. Wright has attempted to capture this coping with a kaleidoscope of fading memories by using a combination of colour, semi abstract shapes and textures, produced using real paint and pastels, and then manipulated using digital animation techniques. The sound track heightens the sense of foreboding and fear as the approach of ‘unmindfulness’ nears.

Turmoil Evolved,8,Claire Reika Wright,https://www.seditionart.com/claire_reika_wright/turmoil-evolved,"'Turmoil Evolved' is a 3 minute animated video. Wright first conceived the idea of creating a sphere of hundreds of fighting figures in 2015 and a piece entitled simply 'Turmoil' was the result. In 2016 she created an almost disco-like 20 minute version of the work that while hugely disturbing was neither a short film or a viable artwork. In 2017 Wright returned to the animation and totally reworked it to produce a video that finally condenses and successfully conveys her concept.Wright's premise is that from the dawn of time conflict has fuelled evolution on this planet. Mankind has always taken conflict to extremes and has thus, perhaps, evolved more rapidly than other species. The cost of this ability to refine the arts of conflict, particulary now, in a time of huge scientific advances and instant communication, appears to be an increasing turmoil through out the world. Conflict not just on a global scale but also at the very personal level on social media and in the home. Her battling figures fight rather ineffectually but with relentless animosity. 'Turmoil Evolved' is a symbolic representation of these thoughts.Working with 3D figures which she created and animated in Cinema4D Wright then used CGI techniques to produce an animated breakdown of these figures into single minute polygons that created the beginning and end of the work. The HD rendered result was then edited it Final Cut Pro. The sound track is Wright's remix of 'Torment', by Louis Utterson.","'Turmoil Evolved' is a 3 minute animated video.

In 2017 Wright returned to the animation and totally reworked it to produce a video that finally condenses and successfully conveys her concept.Wright's premise is that from the dawn of time conflict has fuelled evolution on this planet. Mankind has always taken conflict to extremes and has thus, perhaps, evolved more rapidly than other species. The cost of this ability to refine the arts of conflict, particulary now, in a time of huge scientific advances and instant communication, appears to be an increasing turmoil through out the world. Conflict not just on a global scale but also at the very personal level on social media and in the home. Her battling figures fight rather ineffectually but with relentless animosity. 'Turmoil Evolved' is a symbolic representation of these thoughts.Working with 3D figures which she created and animated in Cinema4D Wright then used CGI techniques to produce an animated breakdown of these figures into single minute polygons that created the beginning and end of the work. The HD rendered result was then edited it Final Cut Pro. The sound track is Wright's remix of 'Torment', by Louis Utterson.",Introverted,Intuitive,Feeling,Judging

Typography,22,Anna Ridler,https://www.seditionart.com/anna-ridler/typography,"Typography is a video work by Anna Ridler which examines the relationship between machinic and human. The work is part of Becoming, a 2017 exhibition presented by Subject Matter, Sedition and the Royal College of Art.Today, machine learning and artificial intelligence programmes such as DeepMind and Magenta are becoming more involved with art process and will become more influential in the future. In Typography, Ridler explores the tension between what can be seen and understood as a human and what can be seen and understood by a computer as the starting point for a short video that tells the story of the history of language using an alphabet that she has created.The alphabets have been constructed by remixing existing glyphs and fonts to form new letters. For example, “N"" is made up of an “I"" and a “V"" together as “IV” to the human eye; with context, this meaning can be easily recognisable, but to a machine it is not. This allows Ridler to create messages that will make sense visually to a human reader but can potentially obscure meaning to a computer. All glyphs are based on the errors that are found when searching through WikiLeaks data and finding transcription errors between human and machine writing.With Typography, the artist seeks to capture the essence of change, of moving from one state to another as the text changes from being instantly recognisable to almost unreadable.","Typography is a video work by Anna Ridler which examines the relationship between machinic and human.

It is the support, however, that breaks with tradition. Federico Lombardo calls into question an entire system, because although it works with his own hand, walking with his hand, to resume precisely Derrida, he painted not on canvas but on a tablet through a computer screen, using color and digital brushes, printing then the image as if it was a photograph.

WELL,20,David Bickley,https://www.seditionart.com/david-bickley/well,"This project started with a fascination of historic industrial monuments, and has since become a study of the mythic potential of object as narrative. This circular structure is an ancient Irish well — In Irish folklore there is the motif of the “salmon of knowledge"" residing in a well. One theory proposes that the traditional “well” creature would have been a coiled snake, and since snakes are unknown in Ireland, this symbol was replaced with that of a salmon.  I find this interesting when considered in relation to the idea of “spiralled water” — water where the molecules have been aligned into a more easily absorbed form, with many health benefits. When you also consider that the symbol of the medical profession is a snake spiralled around a staff, then a number of significant mythic connections are formed.","This project started with a fascination of historic industrial monuments, and has since become a study of the mythic potential of object as narrative.

This project is a meditation on  on the way in which the world has become increasingly secular only to adopt technology as a new form of mainstream religion.The visuals of this piece were generated through the use of Google Earth’s ‘Street View’ implemented within custom openFrameworks and Processing apps. The criteria for exploration was quite simple - to travel to randomly generated points around the globe to simulate the ability of being in many places at once.Through machine learning I created a generative soundtrack using granular synthesis - the samples of which are determined directly by what the computer sees. For example, If the landscape is a bustling city then electromagnetic recordings of servers can be heard. Conversely, if the scene is placid and green in colour then the sound of birds chirp through the noise.The other sounds present are recordings which have been through a digital process called convolution which allows for the features of one sound to be applied to another. In this case I took Apple’s classic text-to-speech voices and applied it to ancient Byzantine chants to create a hybrid cybernetic character to vocalize the idea of a new age of technological devotion.","This work proposes a ‘Church Of Technology’ that holds Google as its one true God.

ПЛАТ - Fabric was produced by generating meshes using 3D animation software and applying digitally rendered surface textures. The work explores the properties of existing and hypothetical fabrics, and looks closely at the textures and movements of textiles we experience peripherally on a daily basis.

音の彫刻,15,Tony Broyez,https://www.seditionart.com/tony-broyez/3c304e5e-8133-4490-b6bd-643e92cb4775,"音の彫刻 (literally 'sculpture of sound') is part of an iterative study exploring the aesthetic visual potential of digital audio datas extraction and analysis.In order to explore audio datas as a material, Tony Broyez developed a custom software in c++/opengl: audio datas can be captured from any source and visualised through a set of algorithms, exported to an XML format to be recreated later and the vector-based visual output can be scaled and saved to the disk at any resolution.Using a specific category of sounds, one algorithm generates organic, nature inspired, flower-like geometrical shapes. Two of those procedurally generated images (at 18,000 * 18,000 pixels) are currently used in a wall covering project for offices designs in the United States. It was part of a collaboration with american photo-based artist Shoshannah White.This particular piece, 音の彫刻, is a composition of 2 audio-reactive images post-processed with film grain and glitch art technics.","音の彫刻 (literally 'sculpture of sound') is part of an iterative study exploring the aesthetic visual potential of digital audio datas extraction and analysis.In order to explore audio datas as a material, Tony Broyez developed a custom software in c++/opengl: audio datas can be captured from any source and visualised through a set of algorithms, exported to an XML format to be recreated later and the vector-based visual output can be scaled and saved to the disk at any resolution.Using a specific category of sounds, one algorithm generates organic, nature inspired, flower-like geometrical shapes.
